The \"barren rock\" as you term it was not an idle conquest, it was of interest because it was a wonderful natural port that allowed British garrisons to watch the Chinese sea trade and collect levies and keep shipping opium to China from India while supplying whores and gambling boats to mainland Chinese. Earlier the British were not allowed to maintain permanent garrisons in China or do banking and finance. Read up the history of HSBC.\n\nIndian farmers in Bengal and Orissa had plenty to eat before the British, but they couldn't eat the Opium they were forced to cultivate by the British. You really should read about this portion of our history - the farmers were debt trapped into becoming indentured slaves. Their wives and children would work in the fields too, and they'd be mutilated and tortured if they grew and food grains instead of the cash crops. Any grains so grown were torched. Their lands only grew opium and indigo which weren't edible, and the British reneged on their promise to pay a fair price for the crops by calculating usurious interest rates on small loans that the farmers were tricked into taking decades earlier.\n\nGenerations of Indian farmers were sacrificed for profit.\n\n--\n\nAustralia was settled violently by killing the native population, forcing them to do hard labor - such as laying roads and building the cities. After slavery and forced labor was stopped Australia hasn't seen a single new city being built.\n\nAustralia is even now uncovering fresh atrocities that were done to the natives. Much of the money for the development of Australia came from India. We literally paid for Australia to be settled. Indian soldiers stood guard over Chinese coolies who built Australia.\n\nThere's so much Australian history to cover, I really can't go into detail here. You will find a lot to read if you're interested.\n\n--\n\nGibraltar like Hong Kong was a vital choke point on marine trade, the British would levy taxes on passing ships and the island was given to all sorts of vices like Hong Kong - gambling, dirty finance, things illegal elsewhere. The wealth isn't from honest work. Gibraltar remains well to do thanks to the dirty finance that still happens today, as does the gambling and vice. It's easy to get away with this when you don't have a large local population to fall prey to the vices.\n\n--\n\nMumbai and Chennai's sewers were built using Indian labor, Indian wealth and Indian materials. The drains weren't for use by Indians - these areas were exclusively for the British. No expense was spared even when the country was starving.\n\nThe point is - if you don't care about the rest of India a small elite can have a great quality of life. Thankfully we don't do that anymore.","Please don‚Äôt move the goal posts. You said Britain didn‚Äôt benefit, what I‚Äôm saying is their livelihoods improved a whole lot, and was the envy of many western nations during that time. Thanks.","**Violence against Indians in Australia controversy**\n\nIn 2009, the media of Australia, mostly in Melbourne, Sydney, and India publicised reports of crimes and robberies against Indians in Australia that were described as racially motivated. There were accusations of intense Hinduphobia along with the racist hate crimes.\n\nRallies were organised in Melbourne and Sydney, and intense media coverage of the perceived hate crimes commenced in India, which were mostly critical of Australian and Victorian Police. The Australian government initially called for calm as it began an investigation into the crimes.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot\u0026message=Excludeme\u0026subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","*carefully he‚Äôs a hero*"],"permalink":"/r/india/comments/c5znrj/india_and_pakistan_fight_in_court_for_45_million/","author":"ppatra","title":"India and Pakistan fight in court for $45 million stashed in London bank since 1947","distinguished":null,"upvote_ratio":0.99,"score":221}

Despite the cold weather, a group of farmers is guarding the gate of the village secondary school at Saipur, a village situated around 30 km from Aligarh town. The villagers have locked up around 100 stray cattle in the school building.\n\n\u003e‚ÄúThe village has around 600 bighas of agricultural land on which we are trying to grow wheat,‚Äù said Chandra Mohan Singh (55). ‚ÄúMore than half the crop has been damaged by stray cattle. This has happened although we guard our farms at night.‚Äù\n\n...\n\n\n\u003eCattle has been part of the agriculture ecosystem. Over past one year, this ecosystem has been disturbed as farmers who once took pride in keeping cattle at home, have found them to be their biggest enemies. The BJP government under Yogi Aditynath has been very strict on animal slaughter and most of the illegal slaughter houses are shut. In May 2017, the central government came up with an order on Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which restricted the sale of cattle in the market for slaughter. Cow protection groups have also become super active, making it impossible to transport cattle from one place to another.\n\n\u003e‚ÄúEarlier, we used to sell the male calf or unproductive cattle such as older cows for around Rs 4,000 to 5,000. Now, we can‚Äôt sell them. So, we leave them on the streets,‚Äù said Parveen Kumar (48) of Dabathwa village of Meerut district. Kumar said the cost of one animal per month is around `6,000 and it becomes difficult for farmers to maintain it, especially if the cattle is of no use. Farmers also complain of a sharp decline in the price of cattle in the past one year.\n\nWho's going to pay 6000rs/cow/month when iit and the government builds cowshalas to corral stay cattle that no one wants? Remember, the government spends less than 300rs/month/child for the midday meal. You think feeding cows no one wants should be the priority this resource poor country with massive hunger and malnutrition problems?\n\nNow, unlike you, IITs are engineering institutions. IIT Bombay has something they can offer to solve the problem, and building cowshalas isn't it. IITs can work on understanding the cow cycle and suggesting solutions that don't involve letting humans starve while cows either go on a rampage, destroying property and hurting people, or eat up so much for sitting in a place that there's very little left for humans. As engineers, understanding how complex systems work is their core expertise. Building and maintaining cowshalas isn't. The only reason why it is happening is because they are trying to balance the bigotry of their political masters with the anger of the students threatened by stray cattle. If this is how the premier science and engineering institutions of this country behave, bending over backwards to accommodate politics, knowing very well it's bad science, the future of this country is bleak.","Gg, understood"],"permalink":"/r/india/comments/cdtw43/after_bull_run_iitbombay_plans_gaushala_on_campus/","author":"charavaka","title":"After bull run, IIT-Bombay plans gaushala on campus | Mumbai News - Times of India","distinguished":null,"upvote_ratio":0.85,"score":50}

In almost every case of hate crime and lynching the Karwan e Mohabbat has followed, the police have registered complaints against the victims, charging them with cow slaughter, animal cruelty, violence, even rash driving. The victims are often jailed. So, instead of fighting for justice against their attackers, they become preoccupied with marshalling their own defence. In time, the police or village elders broker an out-of-court ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù: the victim will claim not to recognise their attackers and in return the police will not pursue the criminal cases against them.\n\nThe family had to leave their house and move to a different village at the end. \n\nPehlu Khan‚Äôs death was not the end of his family‚Äôs misery.

Remember that the accused have the political backing of the RSS / BJP. The supporters of the accused claim that the victim was transporting cattle and thus they were \"justified\" in attacking him to save \"gowmatha\". \n\nAnd it could be very well true that the victim was transporting cattle for slaughter. Obviously that does not justify the violent attacks against him.

Section 5 of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995 and Rules, 1995 pertains to prohibition of the export of bovine animals for the purpose of slaughter and regulation of temporary migration or export for other purposes.\n\n\u003e According to Section 6, the transporter is also an abettor and is liable for the same punishment as the person committing the offence. Section 8 is about the penalty for such offences while Section 9 mentions punishment for causing hurt to a bovine animal.\n\nAlso note that just because the police believes there is a case, doesn't mean the accused are guilty - a court determines that.","Muslims should never place their faith in Congress.

This caused a huge vacuum in both political and religious leadership in the community. And it still continues so in north India. That is why muslims in South India are much, much better off than their northern counterparts. (The Muslim League still exists in Kerala, and even wins in many Hindu dominated areas). Most opted to stay in India, and many from the south who migrated, actually requested to come back again. \n\n(A south indian muslim retired indo-british army officer once told me that if he hadn't made the mistake of transferring to Pakistan and stayed in the Indian Army, he would have retired as a very high ranking general. But when he requested to come back to India, Nehru's office told him he could come back but not join the indian army again). \n\nThat said, it is an undeniable fact that the Congress has lifted millions of Indians (muslims included) out of poverty. And the Sachar committee study and report proved that the Congress was conscious of the needs of the community and working to fulfill it. (Remember how controversial the Sachar committee report was?)","\u003e ... that's why the community is taken for granted by the party.\n\nAgain, that's bull shit. Muslims understand the power of the community because their whole religion is structured like that (Islam brought together all the tribes in Arab under it and their earlier leaders were democratically elected). If the muslims didn't like the Congress or the candidate, they vote for someone else. Why do you think elections today are lost by just 100's of votes?

It is just a propaganda to equate the Congress with the RSS / BJP.\n\n(Since I have to keep repeating this again and again, I'll make a post about this so we can all discuss it one place.)","There's no such thing as *soft* hindutva. hindutva is RSS ideology and is always hard and cruel. \n\nThis b.s. is being spouted by bhats to try and create a rift and then remove any support non-Hindutvawadis have from the political system.\n\nWhy are you vomiting their nonsense without thinking it through?","Winning more votes than their opponents made them CMs. Nice caste-angle twist maara hai aapne. \n\nAadhe bhakt lage hai Muslim-bashing mein, aur aadhe Dalit-bashing mein.

Check data till 1990 and you will find that Congress literally did nothing for Muslims. Congress actually harmed Muslim by promoting weak, religious fanatic, conservative, slave leaders. Leader who actually cared for Muslims were never supported, exception being Maulana Azad. \n\n\n\nAnd stop talking about what happened in 1947. That is the stupidest argument. You can't use 75 year old history to justify situation of today. And south Indian Muslims are rich because south is rich. Check how comparatively poor Karnataka has poor Muslims.","You can't equate two parties which stand for different principles. But that doesn't prevent the INC or any other party from practicing politics which pleases the majority. The soft hindutva stance of congress is well known and demonstrated multiple times. India's progress won't come from being either pro or anti any party. It will come from accepting our shortcomings and trying to remedy them.","It was a simple yes/ no question. We dalits are doing nation building since forever.

Are you even Muslim?","\u003e And whatever progress happened in Muslim community, it is just side effect of liberalization and capitalism. \n\n**You are deliberately pushing a very biased propaganda with selective facts.**\n\nWhen it comes to wiping out poverty, obviously the Congress (or any other secular and inclusive party) cannot create a poverty alleviation programs for a specific religious community. And the Congress has always looked at the poor as poor and most of **their larger welfare schemes, like MNREGA or RTF or RTE have never discriminated based on religion** or caste or geography. \n\nThe Congress has ensured educational opportunities for muslims through scholarship schemes, provided them representation in politics and the government, ensured their religious freedom, ensured they didn't feel as a minority and were part of of India as Indians. In effect, **a muslim in India had the same opportunities as an equivalent Hindu or a Christian or a Sikh and so on**. (Note though that the rise of the RSS / BJP has changed this in the recent decade in some parts of India).  \n\nApart from this there are various welfare schemes directed towards all minorities (not just the muslims) and some specifically for muslims. \n\n**It remains a fact that the Congress has lifted millions out of poverty, and that includes indian muslims too.**\n\nMoreover, I beg to differ that there is something quite unique about poverty in the muslim community. Certain factors are historical as I explained before - the south retained their muslims leaders, while their northern brethren suffered due to migration of their leaders. **Irrespective of their religion, the poor are poor in India because of lack of opportunities and societal prejudices.** A lot of Congress government policies effectively address both these issues and have been successful. \n\n**Thus it is very disingenuous to say that the Congress didn't do anything for muslims.** They treated muslims as any other indian, and that feeling of security is what most indians desire first and foremost.","\u003e The soft hindutva stance of congress is well known and demonstrated multiple times.\n\nObviously the false propaganda has gained some tract, but nevertheless the fact is that it is false.","It wasn't a simple yes/no question. Your claim is disingenuous. I don't give a rats ass about the political parties like INC \u0026 RSS-BJP. Both are equally screwed up and hell-bent on screwing the people over.

But as a dalit I am not against Muslims.\n\n\n\u003e Congress has always looked at the poor as poor and most of their larger welfare schemes, like MNREGA or RTF or RTE have never discriminated based on religion or caste or geography.\n\n\nSame is true with BJP welfare schemes. Constitution doesn't allow discrimination based on religion.\n\n\n\u003e It remains a fact that the Congress has lifted millions out of poverty, and that includes indian muslims too.\n\n\nThis is why I told you to check situation before 1990. Most of the poverty from India was removed after 1990, it was liberalization which removed poverty, and not Congress. \n\n\n\n\u003e Moreover, I beg to differ that there is something quite unique about poverty in the muslim community. \n\n\nI have literally posted link saying there is something unique about poverty in Muslims. Muslims have less upward mobility than even dalits, thus if you are born dalit then you have better chance to get out of poverty than Muslims. First you need to accept situation, then only you can change it. \n\n\n\u003e Irrespective of their religion, the poor are poor in India because of lack of opportunities and societal prejudices.\n\n\nYou are not a Muslim, are you?\n\n\n\u003e Thus it is very disingenuous to say that the Congress didn't do anything for muslims\n\n\nCongress actively harmed Muslim and dalit interests. They promoted weak, conservative, slave leaders who only wanted power. All Congress Muslim leadership is from Muslim rich families. No poor families were represented. Congress did nothing for Muslim women, in fact they actually harmed their interests. \n\n\n\nI like leaders like owesi, he doesn't have to depend on Hindu votes to get elected, so he can talk about actual problems of Muslims. There is young leadership in Muslim community which is modern, and which understand basic problems. Even they agree that Congress didn't do much for Muslims.","\u003e India may have lifted at least 170 million people out of poverty since 1990, but new research suggests overall upward mobility has barely changed since the 1950s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003e Instead, Indian men born to fathers in the bottom of the socioeconomic distribution are just as likely to stay in the bottom today as they were in the 1950s, according to a working paper (pdf) by Sam Asher, Paul Novosad, and Charlie Rafkin from the World Bank, Dartmouth College, and MIT, respectively. This, despite the fact that India‚Äôs economy surged in size over the study period, which was based on data from 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003e The researchers say this is the result of a counterbalance between a substantial rise in upward mobility for the historically-marginalised scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs), who have access to reserved seats in educational institutions and jobs, and a substantial decline for Muslims. The latter have become the least upwardly mobile group in India.\n\n\nhttps://qz.com/india/1399537/indian-muslims-have-the-least-chances-of-escaping-poverty/amp/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want voice in this conversation then you should read above link and four sublinks in that article. This all data is from 2012, and I agree you need to let blame lie on right feet.\n\n\nThere is a reason why some Muslims vote for owesi even when they know their vote is practically wasted.","\u003e Yes I am pushing propaganda for liberalization and capitalism because I believe in them. \n\nNo, the propaganda you are pushing is that the Congress doesn't care about the welfare of the muslim community, which has no basis in fact.\n\n\u003e Same is true with BJP welfare schemes.\n\nAnd that's because the constitution doesn't allow them to discriminate against the muslims through such welfare schemes. That doesn't mean they don't try. In fact, muslims are actually worse off in most BJP ruled states. \n\n\u003e ... it was liberalization which removed poverty, and not Congress. \n\nBullshit - since independence, India has been striving for economic growth and prosperity without sacrificing our independence and it is is the various institutions nurtured by the Indian National Congress that has allowed India today to partly realise the fruits of liberalisation. (I say partly because unfortunately with the weakening of the Congress, and the rise of the right-wing, competitive capitalism has given way to crony capitalism that has further increased the gap between the rich and the poor). \n\n\u003e I have literally posted link saying there is something unique about poverty in Muslims. Muslims have less upward mobility than even dalits, thus if you are born dalit then you have better chance to get out of poverty than Muslims. First you need to accept situation, then only you can change it. \n\nYes, perhaps that was a poor choice of words.\n\nYou forget that most of these studies have been done or initiated by the Congress government. There have been various social studies done to identify social, cultural and political issues in various communities. And where the constitution allows, community specific welfare schemes have been introduced to address this. An e.g. in the muslim community is ensuring that Madrasas also teach other subjects, and providing government funds for the same. So it is not as if the studies are being ignored or not done at all. \n\nThat is why we even have a separate ministry to worry about the welfare of the minorities.\n\nHowever, social and cultural issues can only be addressed by political goodwill, and that is why the Congress works so hard to earn the trust of muslims (as it does with other communities). And it is one of the few parties that does it quite well.  \n\n\u003e\u003e Irrespective of their religion, the poor are poor in India because of lack of opportunities and societal prejudices.\n\u003e You are not a Muslim, are you?\n\nHow does that matter to what I said? \n\n\u003e All Congress Muslim leadership is from Muslim rich families. No poor families were represented. Congress did nothing for Muslim women, in fact they actually harmed their interests. \n\nIt's a unique nature of the Congress that even though many of their leaders were rich and successful NRI's (at some point) or rich and powerful former rulers and / or bureaucrats, the Congress still remains one of the few parties in India that has genuine concern for the poor and weak. And thus gives them more political space than others. Do you know that when the indian constitution was being drafted, many indian and westerners were against giving the vote for the poor and the landless and the uneducated. Yet, it was the Congress leadership that stood ground and ensured they had the right to vote. Congress leaders like C Rajagopalachari left the Congress because Congress resisted adopting capitalism as its economic policy. \n\nEven though the leaders of the Congress have been rich, they ensure that only those who respect their ideology are allowed to rise up the rank. And their inclusive ideology includes addressing the concern and welfare of the poor, irrespective of their community.\n\n\u003e No poor families were represented. \n\nAgain, that is false propaganda. E.g. Kamaraj, Congress CM of Madras / Tamil Nadu state and a former President of the Indian National Congress was not well off. \n\n\u003e I like leaders like owesi, he doesn't have to depend on Hindu votes to get elected, so he can talk about actual problems of Muslims.\n\nLol. Politicians like Owaisi can never deliver on their promises, and actually harm the community they pretend to speak for because they create an us vs them mentality against their community. India is a land of thousands of community, and so indians don't like politicians who only speak for one community. Even Mayawati could win UP only when she spoke inclusively about the Brahmins and the Yadavs too. \n\nThe Congress is respected because they speak for the poor and the rich, they speak for the Hindus and the muslims, the dalits and the upper castes and so on - they give voice to every community so that everyone feels heard and respected. And that is something no other political party in India does as well."],"permalink":"/r/india/comments/c6vlze/pehlu_khan_lynched_in_rajasthan_in_2017_now_a/","author":"iAmNotPunnetsFather","title":"Pehlu Khan, Lynched In Rajasthan In 2017.

In 1948, negative discrimination on the basis of caste was banned by law and further enshrined in the Indian constitution, however the system continues to be practiced in India with devastating social effects.[12]","Dude, it's brahmin/brahman not brhamin.","I saw Aakrosh.

The government should just not recognise the divorce unless it‚Äôs done through proper legal channels.","Why was a Hindu code bill introduced instead of a Universal Civil code? \n\nNehru's original \"secular\"-sin","Triple Talaq is something that Islam itself traditionally frowns upon. Scholars warn against it and it's generally strongly disliked. Its sole purpose was to serve as a remedy for the *really* troubled marriages and some historians believe that it was originally granted by the Prophet as a means for the 'women' who were married to the most despicable men so that they'd escape that relationship as soon as possible. But, as often tends to happen with most well-intentioned laws, people managed to find the loopholes and favored the 'letter' of the law over the 'spirit' of the law. And as such, most Muslims would be absolutely okay with the illegalization or nullification of triple talaq, but more on that towards the end.\n\nSpeaking of laws and women, Islam is the first religion in history to have given women 'rights': social rights, ownership rights, inheritance rights, marriage rights, the right to initiate divorce, the right to remarry, the right to be a witness and give testimony in matters requiring the same, the right to do business (the Prophet's first wife, Khadijah, was a wealthy merchant herself), the right to fight in battle and many many more. Fourteen HUNDRED years ago. \n\nBut, over time, some Muslims twisted the teachings of Islam to suit their own purpose, misused and downright *violated* the very laws of Islam protecting the sanctity of women's rights.. And, over time, it also became okay for the rest of the world to somehow always find a way to judge the 'entirety' of the Muslim community and religion based on the examples set by these worst of Muslims, who are completely unrepresentative of both Islam and most Muslims. \n\nAnyway, before I digress, coming back to divorce.. So, more than 1400 years ago, Muslim women were granted the right to initiate divorce through the legal sharia process referred to as *'khula'*. (This when women around the world were either burned at the stake for wanting rights or had to promise to be married to the same man for seven lives or had to throw themselves into the pyre with him when he died.)\n\nThis is what the normal, the more 'preferred' mode of talaq (divorce) looks like: It's supposed to be done in three stages, over a period equaling roughly three months, and only after the grounds for it have been firmly established (infidelity, adultery, betrayal, loss of affection, etc). Even this 'normal' form of divorce is only meant to be the 'last resort' when nothing seems to have worked to save the marriage. The first month, provided the grounds for divorce are not major (infidelity and/or adultery) and if there is the slightest hope for reconciliation, both the spouses are encouraged to find common ground and rethink their stance, the second month, once again, is time for reflection and possible reconciliation, and only at the end of the third month, when *all* attempts at reconciliation have clearly failed, is the divorce deemed to be finalized and can the spouses part ways.\n\nAnyway, THAT is the 'normal' approach of going about divorce in Islam. And surprise surprise, THAT is how most Muslims actually go about getting a divorce. Most Muslims, too, generally hate the idea of triple talaq. Remember, it's *supposed* to be an absolute last-resort measure, *if that*. Here's a report based on a survey which found that of all the divorce cases amongst Muslims, a mere '0.3' percent were identified as those performed through triple talaq. Less than 1 percent. \n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unimportance-of-triple-talaq-supreme-court-muslim-law-4678304/\n\nYes, 0.3 percent. THAT is how low the incidence of triple talaq really is. Let me just say it once again so it really sinks in. ZERO POINT THREE percent. \n\nBut, how many of you knew that? Or rather, how many of you were led to believe that 'most' of the divorces among Muslims happen the triple talaq way? Or that it's so prevalent among Muslims that 'millions' of Muslim women are simply abandoned by their husbands within seconds? Or that it's because Islam itself encourages it? Or that it's because women simply have no rights in Islam to begin with? \n\nMany, if not everyone. \n\nThat brings us now to the second, the hidden yet the more important part of this discussion: the 'politics, propaganda and Islamophobia' aspect of it. \n\nIf you could time-travel to today's India from ten years before, odds are you'd find it barely recognizable. 2019 was supposed to be the year when we were just a year away from the watershed moment we dreamed of that would forever change our nation's destiny. We were going to be a developed, happy, prosperous nation, the vision of APJ Abdul Kalam come to life. \n\nBut, it's safe to say that that dream is much farther from being a reality *today* than it was ten years ago. And however unrealistic or unattainable that dream may have been to begin with, I am sure nobody in their wildest dreams ever imagined an India where a 'terrorist' would be elected to the parliament and become a 'lawmaker' in 2019.\n\nA deeply radicalized, bigoted and easily manipulated religious majority has set the country back by many many years, if not decades. Such is the level of toxic propaganda and such is the intolerance of the truth that nothing and absolutely nothing seems to have the potential to stem the flow of this madness anytime soon. \n\nAnd it is in this backdrop that it became possible for a man who abandoned his mother, abandoned his wife decades ago and presided over riots that saw hundreds of women get brutally killed and thousands get raped, to rise to be the 'messiah' for Muslim women and their rights and for everyone else to buy into this whole charade. \n\nAnd this allowed everyone to believe that the 'logical' solution to correct the injustice of triple talaq was to 'jail' the man for three years based on a report filed by almost anyone, keep the woman on a measly welfare fund for the same duration, keep her children far away from their father and, thus, eventually, to 'save' the marriage. \n\nIf you still think that the triple talaq bill, in its present manifestation, is anything other than a deeply hateful, vengeful exercise of power through which to punish Muslims for, well, *being* Muslims, you clearly are on the wrong side of history. \n\n\nhttps://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/triple-talaq-bill-a-cannonball-that-can-bring-down-an-entire-household-118010100141_1.html","Because Muslims","\u003e \"People who are opposing the bill are not worried about the condition of those women who have been suffering due to the archaic rule.

Doing triple talaq which already means nothing and doesn't cause divorce legally is punishable with 3 years imprisonment.\n\nWhile deserting your wife is legal.\n\nSaying words which mean nothing is equivalent to child marriage and burning women alive. Actually deserting your wife is perfectly legal. Nice logic according to BJP","Are you saying we should make sati legal again as law is not properly enforced anyway?","So you want all men who abandon their wives to be jailed for 3 years? Shall we start with the dear leader to make an example to discourage every one?","The real problem is men leaving their wives instantly without going through the full process of arbitration, trying to reconcile through counseling, etc. The solution is not definitely not jailing someone just because they divorced their wife. Rioting has a 2 year sentence. Causing someone‚Äôs death through negligence (road accident) is also 2 years. How does abandoning your wife deserve 3 years? \n\nThe solution imo would be to pass a universal women‚Äôs rights bill for women of all religions that ensures a quicker legal recourse to women who have been abandoned by their husbands. As it is, SC says triple talaq is invalid so that person is still married. When a women files a case, ensure the husband supports her financially in the present and also the future if they decide to divorce. Fine the man an initial amount as soon as he does triple talaq maybe. Asaduddin owaisi had some points on this during TV debates. They happened some time ago, so you‚Äôll have to look it up.

He‚Äôs a barrister so he raised some points about how some of the things in the bill are unconstitutional.","\u003eDeterrence is a thing, it can work quite well in practice\n\nThere is such a thing called fair punishment. When a person who causes someone's death through negligence is punished with 2 years, how does abandoning your wife justify 3 years? \n\n\u003eSC also ruled that it exists and is a thing, albeit an illegal thing now, different from mere wife abandonment. The same way sati is different from mere euthanasia, child marriage is different from mere arranged marriage, etc.\n\nHow is it different from wife abandonment if the divorce is invalid? Saying talaq three times is just mere words with no meaning now. Sati is completely different from euthanasia. No one's saying they're the same. Euthanasia is by choice, sati isn't. \n\n\u003eTriple talaq is different from wife abandonment by virtue of the fact that, if nothing else, the former is considered morally permissible by many Muslims while the latter is recognized as a sin. Different practices, different crimes, different punishments\n\nHow is a person's virtue applicable here? If my religion says that murder is bad, is that enough for the courts? Will they say, let him go he's a sinner and will face judgement later? And btw I was talking about how non Muslims can abandon their wife without consequences but when a Muslim does it, he is to be jailed for 3 years?\n\n\u003eTriple talaq is a real problem with real victims that are created every single day. This bill aims to address that very real problem\n\nThis Bill does nothing to address the real problems and only looks to further hurt the Muslim community.","\u003esame crime\n\nIt's like saying the Catholic Church selling indulgences is the same crime as a government official asking for bribes and the punishment for both should be exactly the same. Cracking down on priests selling indulgences is unfair punishment to Christians!","*As such, most Muslims would be absolutely okay with the illegalization or nullification of triple talaq.*\n\nThe last sentence in the first para. Is this your first day reading something online?\n\nNobody's opposing the bill because it's something Muslims want to continue. People are opposing it because it's rooted in anti-Muslim bigotry and its actual implementation does more harm than good. \n\nIf you think that jailing a man for three years for divorcing his wife is going to be 'good' for the wife, that *right there* is how retarded you are.\n\nAlso. \n\n*Well currently the other religions do a better job of that, and that right there is the problem*\n\nThat right there is a wholesome joke. Remind me again, which society has killed 12 million girl fetuses because it values sons waaay above daughters and which is the most dangerous country in the world for women and also remind me what are the rights of Dalit women under Manu Smriti?","I want triple talaq practice to be abolished? Do you want triple talaq to be abolished or not?\n\nHow many people have actually been arrested because of triple talaq?","It's being criminalised because of the societal acceptance of triple talaq divorce. The supreme court making it illegal will only affect the states' perception of the status of the marriage (together) and not the society's perception of that marriage (broken). You can't legislate away a widely accepted societal norm without any deterrence factor.\n\nLook at dowry or finding out the sex of your to be born baby. Both of these are criminal acts in India and not in the rest of the world. In India even politely and without coercion demanding dowry is a criminal offence unlike in say, USA, because the deterrent factor is necessary to reform society. Asking for money to marry someone would not even be a civil offence in other countries.","Please tell the poor woman, Ishrat Jehan, that saying triple talaq means nothing. Poor woman for kicked out, sent to SC, won the case and got ostracized by the community. But for a Muslim male, this suffering is nothing. Muslim men can't abandon their wife just by using 3 words. \n\nJust imagine, how the Muslim men have been victimised /s","I didn't say that. Social evils cannot be defeated by legislation alone. Was there conversation with the Muslim community before the bill was drafted? Often social disapproval can do better than legislation. Criminalizing a civil offence (in the case of TT) is not the best way forward","The law is not for abandonment, it's for triple talaq. The act of triple talak is quite explicit and there's a stated procedure.","I too love child marriage.","\u003eNobody's opposing the bill because it's something Muslims want to continue.\n\nSorry to have to break it to you, but despite your impeccable intentions, that's exactly what opposing the bill will end up doing - it will result in the tradition continuing to be practiced for decades longer\n\n\u003ejailing a man for three years for divorcing his wife is going to be 'good' for the wife\n\nThe wife in the article already said that that's exactly what she wants to happen to her husband as punishment for his heinous crime. It's not merely a matter of divorce, but the brutal way in which it is done on a whim and with no advance notice whatsoever. You think you, a random redditor, know better than her, the victim of the practice? If so, then that right there is how retarded you are\n\n\u003eRemind me again, which society has killed 12 million girl fetuses blah blah blah\n\nIs this your first day reading something online? You must have missed the part which I even quoted in my previous post where the author of the article addressed that very argument. Here, I'll bold it for you:\n\n\u003eEven **dreaded Hindu traditions like Sati and child marriage has been abolished**. They too were against women, so why not Triple Talaq\n\nHindus have already passed laws to crack down on problematic Hindu traditions, such as sati and caste discrimination. You want to know why India is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women? It's because of Muslim traditions such as triple talaq that people like you refuse to allow the government to properly penalize","\u003eHow many people have actually been arrested because of triple talaq?\n\nHow many people have been arrested for something that is a civil case? what kind of question is that? Tripple talaq is illegal. The court has already decided that. I wish that decision had come decades ago. I don't believe the people who abandon their spouses should be jalied, whether or not they utter abra-ka-dabra. I do want their spouses to be able to drag them to court and get the civil issues arising out of such abandonment sorted. I want the government to support such lawsuits with providing legal as well as financial support. Do you actually want the abandoned woman to be helped, or do you simply want the husband to be jailed for being muslim while leaving?\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nNow answer the question:\n\n\\\u003eDo you want all men who abandon their wives without due process to be  similarly jailed, or you do you want only the men who utter those words  before throwing their wives out to rot?","Do you want all men who abandon their wives without due process to be similarly jailed, or you do you want only the men who utter those words before throwing their wives out to rot?","\u003e Muslim men can't abandon their wife just by using 3 words. \n\nWhile others can just abandon their wives without using any words at all. And never mind the fact that after Supreme Court judgment they would still be married.\n\nSuch a grievous crime in the same league as sati and child marriage that desertion is allowed for all other communities. Doesn't modi care about Hindu women? Or does it think it's okay since he deserted his own wife.","So your solution is to disapprovingly stare whenever a guy who did TT comes along. WTF do you mean by social disapproval? Even Pakistan which still has blasphemy laws outlawed TT.","Precisely. You are trying to target a specific religion, rather than a social problem. Wives getting abandoned without a due legal process that can safeguard their interests is a problem, not some mumbo jumbo being uttered by a minority of those men while doing so.","\n\u003eHow many people have been arrested for something that is a civil case? what kind of question is that? \n\nSo you have no idea on how many people are impacted but you decided to put on your tin foil hat and go about screaming on how this law was made only to put Muslim men in jails?\n\n\u003e\n\u003e\\\u003eDo you want all men who abandon their wives without due process to be  similarly jailed, or you do you want only the men who utter those words  before throwing their wives out to rot?\n\n\nI am fine to jail any fuck who thinks that he can abandon his wife just by using one word thrice. I am fine with jailing people who refuse to support their abandoned wife or indulge in bigamy. I also want to not allow polygamy just because you belong to xyz group.\n\nHowever, there is a much simpler solution. UCC. Let's bring in UCC which will remove all these disparities. But some idiots think UCC is going to destroy \"secularism\". Then they go on Reddit and ask why we have separate laws, punishments etc for the same issues for different religions.","What's stopping them from abandoning their wives without doing triple talaq now? There is a difference legally (in the eyes of the state) as well as socially (in the eyes of the society) between someone who has abandoned his wife versus someone who has said triple talaq and then left. In the latter the society accepts that this marriage is now over and both the husband and wife are now treated as divorced people whereas this isn't the case in the former scenario. There are 2 separate interactions here, between the couple and the state and between the couple in their society. This law is needed because large parts of the society still believes in the validity of instant triple talaq as a means of divorce.\n\nIt is a lot like dowry, asking anyone for money (like your mama, chacha, dada) isn't a crime but because our society has this particular grave evil of dowry therefore we criminalised what should otherwise just be something between the people involved. Don't want to give dowry, don't get married but because India has this case where this social evil was causing real harm to society therefore its criminalisation was created as a deterrent. \n\nPS I'm not talking about dowry deaths or violence, I'm merely talking about how even asking for dowry is a crime in India.","The woman who had to bear the brunt of triple talaq is asking for the bill. But no, we must definitely protect the Muslim man. \n\nBigamy is punishable for all communities other than Muslims. Why should Muslim women alone suffer bigamy? I am sure you would be the forefront of anti-ucc but now, we want equal laws for all.","Supreme Court in last year struck down Section 497 of IPC as unconstitutional. Section 497 criminalizes adultery (which is a civil offence). Adultery is still a legal ground for divorce. You think because of that people are going to come out and show off about how adulterous they are?  \n\nThe question is not whether TT is right or wrong. Everyone agrees it is wrong. Question is whether it should be made a criminal offence because there are grounds for it's misuse. \n\nI mentioned Roop Kanwar because her death could have been avoided if the society thought Sati was wrong. Law condemed it; society didn't. She died. Same goes for every social I'll in the country.","There are laws to prevent female infanticide and screening of babies to determine sex and yet we have low sex ratio. Why is that? Cos our society looks down on female babies \n\nDivorce rate is low in the country because women are not financially independent and society looks down upon it. That's how social factors work.\n\nI am not condoning women staying in abusive relationships or female infanticide. If laws alone can bring in social change then we'd be the most progressive country in the world.\n\nSocial disapproval means getting respected religious leaders to come out and condemn TT. To let everyone know that the man who abandons women shouldn't be treated with respect. If you don't understand how social disapproval works you should figure out why Salman Rushdie's life in danger here even though Constitution guarantees him freedom of life and liberty.\n\nBesides you should read my comment fully. I said legislation 'ALONE' would not be enough and 'CRIMINALIZATION' of civil offence is not the right way forward. How many Muslim countries have made TT a criminal offence with 3 years imprisonment?\n\nJust to put things in perspective homicide due to negligence (IPC 304A) attracts a maximum of 2 years imprisonment. Is TT a bigger crime than that?\n\nMaybe you should read the bill in detail before making noiseüòÄ","\n\u003e Even Pakistan which still has blasphemy laws outlawed TT.\n\nIndian courts have already done that. \n\nThis bill is classic modi, taking credit for things others have done with the added bonus of making Muslims and his opponents look anti-progressive","Sir, please re-read my comment. I am for this law. This is against one particular way of divorce. There are other ways of divorcing in Islam.","\u003e I am fine to jail any fuck who thinks that he can abandon his wife just by using one word thrice. I am fine with jailing people who refuse to support their abandoned wife or indulge in bigamy. I also want to not allow polygamy just because you belong to xyz group.\n\nWell then, Why not push for that law, rather than the one that pushes only muslim men to be jailed?\n\nI would vehemently disagree with you on the need for jailing unless they fail to pay the alimony or other costs imposed when they get dragged to civil court (despite being capable of paying, not because they are bankrupt), but I can understand the motivation.\n\nSince you bring up UCC, in fact, here's an opportunity to come up with a law that applies uniformly regardless of the religion, and yet you want to single out only muslim men because they utter some gibberish before breaching a contract they walked into willingly, while letting others breach the same contract without uttering the same gibberish.","\u003eThere is a difference legally (in the eyes of the state) as well as socially (in the eyes of the society) between someone who has abandoned his wife versus someone who has said triple talaq and then left.\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nHow exactly do you think the society treats a man who's left his wife without uttering abra ka dabra?","Instead of bigamy, others just keep mistresses. If you don't marry, it's perfectly legal to have a side chick. Do you think about that or is it just Muslim women who suffer from bigamy? What's the difference from the wife's perspective if her husband has another woman who he marries or doesn't marry?","How many instances of Sati can you find in last 10 years? Or even last 50 years... Keep in mind the population of the country... You can't point at individual instances and blame the whole society for it. People rape dead pigs that doesn't mean that rapping dead pigs is an epidemic in the country. There will always be outliers in any data point.","\u003e I am for this law.\n\nI know. You don't really care about the plight of the women abandoned by their husbands without dur process, you only care about finding ways to punish muslims.","\u003e\u003e I am fine to jail any fuck who thinks that he can abandon his wife just by using one word thrice. I am fine with jailing people who refuse to support their abandoned wife or indulge in bigamy. I also want to not allow polygamy just because you belong to xyz group.\n\u003e\n\u003eWell then, Why not push for that law, rather than the one that pushes only muslim men to be jailed?\n\nBecause as far as I am aware, Hindus don't abandon their wives by just uttering some chant and the society doesn't accept this Hindu chant as a valid divorce and accepts another marriage by the husband.\n\n\n\n\u003e\n\u003eSince you bring up UCC, in fact, here's an opportunity to come up with a law that applies uniformly regardless of the religion, and yet you want to single out only muslim men because they utter some gibberish before breaching a contract they walked into willingly, while letting others breach the same contract without uttering the same gibberish.\n\nEverytime I brought about UCC, some moron will claim that a sanghi who is majoritarian and secularism will die.\n\n And the day we find Hindus kicking their wives out by saying divorce thrice, them a priest comes and says that the divorce is legal as per Hinduism and to get back together with her husband, the wife has to get married to someone else (priest is always available to be the someone else), consummate the marriage and divorce and get back to husband - I will definitely get the same law for Hindus.","They're not gonna allow the abandoned woman to marry again like they would to a divorcee. If the guy isn't a Muslim then even he can't marry again like a divorcee could. That's the way society differentiates between someone who has abandoned his wife versus someone who has had a divorce.","A marriage is recognized by state and confers rights to the spouse. Mistress doesn't.\n\nIf your problem is lack of uniformity in application of law, UCC is the easiest solution. If you want to enable me to to abandon their wives because of some thing wriiten over a thousand years ago, it is just not acceptable.","Okay. What about female infanticide? Or child marriage? Are they outliers as well? Why are laws not being effective here?","Sir, I was just making a logical point. Your diversionary line of argument leads me to think that you cannot disprove that logic.","\u003e Because as far as I am aware, Hindus don't abandon their wives by just uttering some chant and the society doesn't accept this Hindu chant as a valid divorce and accepts another marriage by the husband.\n\nWhat happens to the wives hindu men abandon?","\u003e to get back together with her husband, the wife has to get married to someone else (priest is always available to be the someone else), consummate the marriage and divorce and get back to husband \n\nTell me, does your triple talaq law abolish this, too? I.e. if a couple goes through a legal divorce process, does the muslim priest in this story go to jail for 3 years?","\u003e  If the guy isn't a Muslim then even he can't marry again like a divorcee could. \n\nAre you claiming that the proposed law is going to change anything for non muslim men? Are you claiming that you don't know hindu men with two wives (doesn't matter whether the law recogizes them as such)? \n\nIf a muslim man can marry another woman anyways and abandoning his wife doesn't make any other difference to him as long as he doesn't say abra ka dabra, what good is this new law going to achieve other than getting more bigot votes for BJP?","Look... I am not denying that the TT act is prone to misuse. Just like dowry act. But your Sati argument was stupid is just I am saying. \n\nDo you recommend we scrap dowry act too? What about instigating riot act? Because politicians use that to frame their opponents.","\u003eSir, I was just making a logical point. \n\nYou were making a political point. If you had tried to reason logically, you'd have seen multiple logical fallacies of supporting the law while claiming to support women.","What happens to the wives that Muslim men abandon without triple talaq?","It's being fought in the court currently","When did I say that? This whole debate was about why criminalise something which should be at best a civil matter. I explained via the example of dowry how you need to sometimes reform society by such a deterrent law.\n\nThe law will stop people from saying triple talaq and divorcing their wives. Now even in their society (where otherwise such a divorce would be considered to be a real divorce regardless of what the state thought) this type of behaviour would not be done out of fear of jail or fine. This law won't change anything for non Muslim men one way or the other. It won't change anything for men abandoning women either except this abandonment wouldn't be considered a divorce now.","Oh fhs I'm not asking you to strike down acts. TT IS A CIVIL OFFENCE NOT A CRIMINAL ONE. HOW MANY TIMES SHOULD I REPEAT THAT TO GET THAT MESSAGE ACROSS?\n\nInstigating riot is not a civil offence. It's blatantly criminal.\n\nWhat exactly are you trying to achieve by making a civil offence criminal?","Or I will rephrase the question this way:\n\nWhat could go wrong by framing a civil offence as criminal offence which specifically targets men from minority community in a country where the police is corrupt and has repeatedly been anti-minority and the judiciary takes years to act? What could possibly go wrong I wonder?\n\nWhat is to stop a man from abandoning his wife without giving out TT? Do you think a man who has been imprisoned for 3 years will provide for subsistence for his wife without holding any grudge? \n\nI am just not convinced this bill is really intent on bringing justice to Muslim womenüòÄ I'd feel convinced if it was a civil offence and there was some fine or 6 months imprisonment instead of 3 years imprisonment or some form of mediation which would ensure that woman is not left in lurch. As I have stated earlier worse crimes have punishment of lesser duration. This just makes the intent of the government susceptible.","Sir, I am not giving my opinion. Please allow me to re-state my question:\n\n\u003e Why would anyone opt for triple talaq if they face a 3 year prison term?\n\nI'll be grateful if you can answer the question without questioning my political or reasoning abilities.","You tell me. Don't you think the abandoned wives of muslim men deserve the same protection if the muslim men don't say Abra ka dabra before doing that?","Why is it not in the \"transformative law\", already? Waiting for the next election?","\u003eIt won't change anything for men abandoning women either except this abandonment wouldn't be considered a divorce now.\n\nthen why not jail everyone who walks out on their spouse without prior arrangements?","\u003e Sir, I am not giving my opinion. \n\nAnd why is that?","That abra ka dabra allowed Muslim men to claim divorce which was accept my the c Muslim society as valid","Ask the court why it decided to break it up","Arey because that's not the concern here. We just don't want people to think that instant triple talaq == divorce.","I just want to ask the question because I think it's an important to ask. But if you insist, here's my opinion on it. \n\nI think that the argument of abandonment is misguided. This law is against a specific practice; it's not about abandonment. Linking it to abandonment (and further to Modi) is a diversionary tactic rather than a sound criticism.\n\nTriple talaq is not the only way of divorce per Sharia Law. Quoting from Wikipedia ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_Islam)). \n\n\u003e Talaq types can be classified into talaq al-sunnah, which is thought to be in accordance with Muhammad's teachings, and talaq al-bid'ah, which are viewed as a bid'ah (innovation) deviations from it. **Talaq al-sunnah is further subdivided into talaq al-ahsan, which is the least disapproved form of talaq**, and talaq al-hasan. **The ahsan talaq involves a single revocable pronouncement of divorce and sexual abstinence during the waiting period.** The hasan divorce involves three pronouncements made during the wife's state of ritual purity with menstrual periods intervening between them, and no intercourse having taken place during that time.\n\n\u003e Shiite jurisprudence does not recognize talaq al-bid'ah.\n\nThere is also Tafwid (delegated talaq) and Khul ø (mutual divorce). \n\nIt is just speculation that ban on triple talaq will lead to more abandonment. It is more likely other legal ways of divorce will be used for legitimate cases.","So you don't really care about the women abandoned. Got it.","\u003eAsk the court why it decided to break it up\n\nThe court decided to break up the proposed law that criminalizes abra ka dabra?","\u003e Arey because that's not the concern here.\n\nSo you're not really concerned about the plight of the women abandoned without resources for taking care of themselves, but are upset about whether the society thinks they're available or not?","**Divorce in Islam**\n\nDivorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The main traditional legal categories are talaq (repudiation), khul ø (mutual divorce), judicial divorce and oaths. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place. Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by sharia, as interpreted by traditional Islamic jurisprudence, though they differed depending on the legal school, and historical practices sometimes diverged from legal theory.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot\u0026message=Excludeme\u0026subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","\u003e This law is against a specific practice\n\nA practice that has already been deemed illegal by the court.

And, despite english being mandatory for the last 70 years, barely 10% of population speaks it, and everyone is adapting. \n\nSo, you changed the goal posts, and then lied that I brought 100% mandatory in the argument.

Having native language doesn't save you from from foreign domination, they can still overtake the market despite the language barrier.\n\n**Here are the facts which you cannot prove wrong so therefore all you do is argue baselessly :**\n\n1.) Hindi imposition makes non-hindi speakers a second class citizens.\n\n2.) English is a lingua franca which benefits the indian populace tremendously.\n\n3.)

It  is  not  so  in  the  case  of national  parties,  inasmuch  as,  they  have  to  mobilise  their  entire machinery  to  contest  all  the  seats  to  the  House  of  the  People  as  well as  on  all  the  seats  to  State  Assemblies.    Therefore,  the  disadvantage,  if any,  in  the  event  of  simultaneous  elections  taking  place,  is  to  the national parties, rather than  to  the State level parties. Further,  if  the  regional  parties  are  able  to  flag  the  local issues  appropriately  before  the  electorate,  the  argument  that  the voters  will  get  carried  away  by  national  issues  in  case  of  simultaneous elections,  will  prove  to  be  flimsy.   In  2014,  for  example,  in  Delhi, during  the  General  Elections  to  the  House  of  the  People,  there  was  a wave  in  favour  of    particular  party  and  all  the  seven  seats  to  the House  of  the  People  were  won  by  that  one  party.  However,  just  after that,  when  the  election  to  Delhi  Legislature  was  held  just  after  few months  in  2015,  there  was  a  complete  back-swing  and  Delhi witnessed  a  sweep  by  the  State  Party,  clearly  indicating  that  the electorate  had  no  confusion  about  whom  they  wanted  at  the  Centre and  who  can  address  their  local  issues.  \n\nSource: Draft report by law commission on simulateous elections.","Or, another way to think about it would be that local issues will gain more relevance, and have consequences on a national level.

When the final NRC was published, those included in the final list would be allotted Aadhaar numbers.\n\n\n\n\u003eChima pointed out that creating an identifiable Aadhaar number is dangerous as the data can be easily used to target people, in the case of NRC, poor, dispossessed people from minority communities.\n\nIn a nutshell, this means the people whose citizenship is contested will have an Aadhar number that is not a random string - but starts with  indentifiable number(s).  This is where the problem lies - this number could be used to discriminate in the future.","I don't understand how adding bio-identification any different from your name, address or any other detail.

Illegal immigrants are a problem in Assam and a big exercise of NRC is carried out and illegal immigrants are identified. Now what these immigrants could do is move to other states and settle there and avoid arrest/deportation. As BJP has promised nationwide NRC to find out such immigrants they would not want to keep identifying the same people again and again hence a database is required. The database has to have biometric data as it is relatively easy to clone another form of ID and create a fake one from it. \n\nI feel that this can be and will be used against citizens someday by someone. There is no doubt that a Cambridge Analytica type of thing can happen and will happen. \n\nAnother argument that this and all the future governments will give is they need data to identify people who need or may need the help of government schemes which is valid to some extent but if you give someone a magic wand and expect them to do only good then you are a fool.\n\nThe only biometric database I feel should exist is a database of convicted and on trial criminals in major crimes like murder and rape.","ditto","But how, since in future they will be deported to Bangladesh?","\u003e  its almost impossible to fake it.\n\nIt's rather easy, if you have access to the prints.

I'm not sure if that practice has stopped over all the airports, yet.\n\nPS: if you must upload fake content instead of stealing someone else's identity, that is as easy as 50rs in your pocket going into the operator's pocket.

PV Narashima Rao - He was a real Chanakya - opened up ties with Israel when Arafat was in India, removed license Raj and liberalized economy while being in coalition with the Communist, fooled americans about the nuclear tests to buy Vajpayee government some time, sent Vajpayee to the UN as the opposition leader to ensure that India appears united on Kashmir issue. Read further - Vinay Sitapati and Sanjaya Baru's book on PV Rao\n2. Atal Bihari Vajpayee - Statesman par excellence despite facing numerous disruptions, he brought us closest to ever finding peace with Pakistan. Took forward the legacy of PV Rao, liberalized telecom sector, brought massive infrastructural projects that help connect India, almost half of the highways in the country was built under his regime. He also envisioned the right to education under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan. Shared a very great relationship with almost all opposition leaders.\n3. Nehru - Full of ideas, had a very secular image and last of the nationalist that didn't require any display of his credentials of patriotism, his only flaw was not realizing that the socialist policies were not working and his miscalculation with China. Both the follies have costed India dearly since then, but those could have been only discovered if one had the foresight of Patel (he died quite early so can't ever envision him in place of Nehru as others do, but he had better understanding of foreign policy) or be brilliant like Rajaji (he created Swantantra Party which was pro-market when almost nobody else in India was). His leadership remains unquestioned, he was liked throughout the country, always harbored overall good intentions seekings what was best for the nation.\n4. Interesting anecdote I happened to attend the book launching of Vinay Sitapati's book on Narashima Rao which included a panel discussion with Shekhar Gupta, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, and C Raja Mohan - When asked whose Prime Ministership was the most transformative - both Shekhar Gupta and Pratap Bhanu Mehta said that of Vajpayee while C Raja Mohan said that each had its own contribution.","We'll never see a south Indian pm again","PVN is easily one of the best.","Very new to Indian politics, could someone please explain what happened during 1996 that the PM only lasted less than a month and then came back 2 years later?

Initiated the MSRP for crops to stabilize the agriculture production in a time where food security was very important. Also I like him for his legendary honesty in a time of honest politicians. (As a farmer like him for his jai jawan jai kisan slogan)","Whatsapp guy is here.","Gulzarilal Nanda was a member of Nehru's cabinet who held the post of Acting Prime Minister twice: after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and after the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri. Both times he held the post for less than 2 weeks, while the majority party, the Congress chose a successor.   \n\n\nAfter Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri was selected as his successor. Shastri is credited for the green revolution which enabled India to achieve food security. He introduced the famous \"Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan\" slogan that has played a key role in Indian politics since then. Shastri led India to victory against Pakistan in 1965, which played a role in the collapse of the Ayub Khan regime in Pakistan (albeit a larger role was played by Jinnah's sister Fatima publicly castigating him and running in the 1965 Presidential election against him). At the peace accords signing between Pakistan and India, hosted at Tashkent, Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan, Shastri died, which has provided much fodder for conspiracy theorists a la Vivek Agnihotri.   \n\n\nThe Congress then picked Indira Gandhi to succeed Shastri. After Shastri went against the Congress high command on multiple occassions, Indira was picked to be a puppet for the Congress high command, a \"Goongi Gudiya\", a dumb doll. However, Indira was anything but. She quickly took command of both her cabinet and the Congress party which split apart into Indira's supporters and opponents, referred to as Indicate and Syndicate respectively. Indira Gandhi's Indicate (Congress (R) had a plurality of seats, but lost it's majority due to the leaving of Syndicate or Congress (R). She formed confidence and supply arrangements with DMK, which enabled her to continue as PM until 1971, wherein after defeating Pakistan and freeing Bangladesh, she managed to regain her majority. This continued until she declared the emergency and then withdrew the emergency in 1977.   \n\n\nSeveral multitudes of people came together to oppose Gandhi's emergency. From the forerunners of the BJP, the Bhartiya Jan Sangh, to the Communists, to the trade unions led by George Fernandes, to socialists like JayPrakash Narayan. When Gandhi ended the emergency and released all political opponents, JayPrakash Narayan who was considered the unofficial leader of opposition to Indira Gandhi demanded that all the opposition parties come together in one alliance against Gandhi, to which they agreed. Thus, the Janata Party was formed through a merger of the Bhartiya Jan Sangh (Vajpayee and Advani's party), the Bhartiya Lok Dal, Rajagopalchari's Swatantrata Party and the Syndicate (the Communists did not heed Narayan's call to form a common opposition party). In the 1977 elections the Janata Party won, making Moraji Desai Prime Minister, however, a party formed by combining militant trade unionists (Fernandes), free market neoliberals (Swatantrata Party), old school Nehruvian socialists (Syndicate), economically left and socially right wingers (BJS)  found it difficult to govern. They were united in their distaste for Indira Gandhi and nothing more.   \n\n\nDesai put Indira Gandhi on trial but found it difficult to prove she committed anything criminal during the Emergency. The continuing trial soon devolved into a witch hunt, which created tensions in the Janata Party. The party next faced a major crisis due to the \"dual membership\" problem. The left members of the Janata Party argued that the Janata Party's guidelines prohibit membership to both the Janata Party and alternate political groups (the RSS). Vajpayee and Advani refused to surrender their RSS membership, and Desai supported them in the dual membership issue. This caused the Janata Party to break up as Charan Singh withdrew his party (the Bhartiya Lok Dal) from the Janata Party. Desai, after losing his majority resigned, and Charan Singh became PM, however, he found it difficult to govern without a majority. The Indicate agreed to engage in coalition talks with him if he withdrew the case against Indira Gandhi, but after he did, voted against him in a motion of no confidence, which led to fresh elections in 1980.   \n\n\nThe country was tired by the infighting of the Janata Party and re-elected Indira Gandhi in 1980. She spent most of her administration focusing on the Punjab issue and was assassinated by her own bodyguards after enabling Operation Blue Star. The Congress decided to chose her son Rajiv Gandhi as her successor, whose administration was overshadowed by rigging elections in Kashmir (albeit to prevent separatists from winning the election), one of the few actual attempts of minority appeasement (the Shah Bano case and it's fallout), and the Bofors scam (of which there is no proof Rajiv was actually involved). Rajiv did do some good, the telecom revolution is thanks to him, and he did lay some seeds for Liberalisation, but he is generally acknowledged as India's worst Prime Minister, and with good reason.   \n\n\nHowever, Rajiv Gandhi was still extremely popular, and the opposition to Rajiv Gandhi was forced to unite, the same way they united against his mother. V. P. Singh merged breakaway parts of the Janata Party, the Lok Dal, and the leftovers of Indicate. This created the first \"Third Front\" in India politics. V. P. Singh led the third front to victory, but needed support of both the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party to come to power. V. P. Singh led his government for a year, but was confronted by the violence of Advani's Rath Yatra. Advani sensing the declining fortune of the BJP to the Third Front, began the Rath Yatra to agitate for the Ram mandir in Ayodhya. V. P. Singh ordered his arrest before he reached Ayodhya as the death toll grew momentous (about 600 people died). This led to the BJP withdrawing support for V. P. Singh, who therefore resigned. V. P. Singh is primarily remembered for his decision to adopt the Mandal Commission report and his decision to arrest Advani. he is remembered as being a firm proponent of secularism and social justice and one of the greatest Prime Minister's India has ever had despite his short tenure.   \n\n\nV. P. Singh's Home Minister Chandra Shekhar became PM, through the outside support of the Congress. He was allowed to lead India during the Gulf war of 1990-1, but after the war ended, the Congress withdrew the support they provided, causing his government to fall without ever passing a single budget. Fresh elections were called, and while campaigning, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by the LTTE. The resulting sympathy wave propelled Congress into having sufficient seats to form a minority government, that required outside support from the Left front and the Third Front. Despite only having a minority government, and requiring the support of Communists, P. V. Narasimha Rao ran the government for a full 5 years, engaging in the Liberalisation Privatisation Globalisation that characterises India's economic policies across all political parties to this day.   \n\n\nDespite this, Narasimha Rao was voted out in 1996, as the country was affected by the transition from a command economy oriented society to a free market society. Vajpayee's BJP gained a plurality but not a majority. The leader of the Janata Party from the 1970s, Subramaniam Swamy, convinced the Congress to ally with Jayalalitha, whose AIADMK was part of Vajpayee's coalition. AIADMK's exit from the coalition and the resulting vote of no confidence ended Vajpayee's fledgling government, and led to a coalition between the Congress, the Communists and the Third Front led by Deve Gowda after V. P. Singh refused to come out of retirement, and the Politburo of the CPIM refused to allow Jyoti Basu to become Prime Minister, even though the Congress offered the post to him. Deve Gowda was unable to reconcile the Congress with the smaller parties under the Third Front, which included the Samajwadi Party, the DMK, the Asom gana Parishad and Chandrababa Naidu's Telugu Desam Party, he was therefore removed and replaced by I. K. Gurjal. Gurjal too found it impossible to reconcile so large a group with such diverse interests, and called fresh elections, which were won by Vajpayee's coalition the NDA. This enabled Vajpayee to complete his first full term as Prime Minister, although he was defeated by Sonia Gandhi's resurgent Congress in 2004.   \n\n\nThe remnants of the Janata Party still led by Subramaniam Swamy was merged with the BJP after Vajpayee's resignation as leader of the Party, and the BJP won the 2014 elections, after 10 years of rule by the Congress under Manmohan Singh, who delivered the fastest economic growth in Indian history, accompanied by social justice measures like the Right to Education, and the Right to Information Act.","Yes.

When the US 7th fleet was ordered into the Bay of Bengal to intimidate India during the 1971 war, Russia mobilized their nuclear subs to tail and intercept the US armada and stopped them from interfering in the war. That was the history of our partnership.\n\nAnd Russia's defence industry is nothing to sneeze at. A great example of that is the S400 procurement we are doing which has features that the American Thaad and Patriot systems don't have. IMO we should quickly make progress on FGFA and subs with Russia. China is going full steam ahead with their indigenous builds. Co-development with Russia is the only way we can build indigneously and export it as well. For all other options we will be reliant on transfer of technology only.","They gonna take our money,give us no tech and them sell the same thing for double the price","Russia and co-development in same sentence never sounds right","Im actually surprised at the amount of semi-evident russian shilling ITT.

If they had helped us in the past, we wouldn't still be so reliant on them.\n\nWe didn't learn how to make Sukhoi engines by assembling Sukhois. We didn't learn how to make MBTs by importing T-90s (the arjun is not quite making the mark). We didn't learn how to make aircraft carriers by importing vikramaditya (Vikrant is a desi creation with an american engine.\n\nWe didn't learn how to make assault rifles despite importing russian assault rifles for most of our country's history. The Ak203 might be the first time we actually make a cutting edge rifle in India but it's not saying much given that it's just a rifle.\n\nThe IAF are not idiots. They pulled out of FGFA because they realized India wasn't gonna learn much from it and Russia was too eager for India to be the first customer. Better to wait for it to prove itself and build AMCA in the meantime. Believe me, India has learned from past mistakes.\n\nThe Russian-Western arms industries have spent many many decades making sure the Indian defence sector relies on their imports rather than making stuff themselves. Part of that blame is Indian but don't tell me that our biggest arms suppliers didn't play their role as well.","even so, if the co-development can speed up the AMCA project by even a few years it would be worth it","This sounds like total ignorance and a propaganda.\n\n**Russia has been India's most reliable defence partner.** They are one of the biggest contributors to our defence research and have provided us technology that the west continues to deny us. \n\n**Brahmos** is an example of a successful collaboration that we have had with Russia, where **India and Russia jointly developed one of the fastest supersonic cruise missile in the world**.","Paisa phenk, tamasha dekh","Say hi to new negotiations","Then you are totally ignorant.\n\n**Russia has been India's most reliable defence partner.** They are one of the biggest contributors to our defence research and have provided us technology that the west continues to deny us. \n\n**Brahmos** is an example of a successful collaboration that we have had with Russia, where **India and Russia jointly developed one of the fastest supersonic cruise missile in the world**.\n\nIt is because of the generous concessions made to India that we even assemble the **Sukhois** in India, contributing to our technological upgradation and knowledge in aviation research.\n\nThe Russians have also provided India with **Cryogenics engines** and allowed us to reverse engineer it and use it on our **GSLV rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles**.","We've been doing it with them for decades though","[deleted]","The context in discussion is not importing defence tech.

Comparing a joint development FGFA project to MiG imports in the past is disingenuous esp regarding an argument about indigenous development. \n\nAnd there is no other nation offering us an option for joint development and we both know that our industry is not yet up to snuff to do it on its own.

And it is by no means an easy task.)","\u003e Vikramdatiya is junk sold to us.\n\nIt was not \"junk\" - they completely refurbished it and sold it to us. In fact it was converted from a hybrid cruiser cum carrier to a full on air carrier as that was our navy's requirement. And they allowed us to be deeply involved in the refurbishment process so we could learn about building and repairing such air craft carriers. That is why we paid billions of dollars for it.","\u003e Brahmos ramjet, the most crucial part that drives the missile, comes from Russia.\n\nIt doesn't matter what \"comes\" from Russia in the Brahmos as we get the full tech and scientific knowledge of everything in Brahmos. As does Russia. So tomorrow if the partnership ends, India can still manufacture the missiles on its own. That is what a collaboration brings - full technology transfer and ownership.  \n\n\u003e We are doing import substitution and other changes on it slowly with our own seekers etc. but R\u0026D is all Russian.\n\nNo. **This kind of putting down of our scientists needs to end**. \n\nScientific research takes a tremendous amount of time and money. The indian policy under the Indian National Congress on scientific research has been simple - **don't waste time rebuilding the wheel**. If the technology and scientific research already exists, get it and build on it. If we can't access it reverse engineer it and learn. And if it is totally denied to us then do full blown scientific research and try to figure out the technology ourselves. \n\nThis is smart and this how we are today a **world leader in nuclear, missile and rocket technology**. And Russia's contribution cannot be ignored in this as they gave us access to nuclear reactors, missile, cryogenic engines etc. to reverse engineer it. \n\n- Our missile development program started by reverse engineering a **russian missile**.\n- Our GSLV and ICBM programs were developed by reverse engineering **russian cryogenic engines** (they were ready to give us the full technology first, but USA obstructed it). \n- Our nuclear submarines are built with **small nuclear reactors** also thanks to russian technology.\n- Our indigenous tanks and fighter planes have also benefited from direct tech transfer and reverse engineering of **russian tanks and fighter planes**.\n- Our **aircraft carriers** are also based on Russian technology.\n\n*(That said, it should be clear that that we also use technology derived from a lot of other countries too.)*\n\n\u003e Sukhois are just screwed in India, majority of the kit is from Russia.\n\nThis snarky remarks betrays your ignorance of how we get technology and scientific knowledge. Today, we can build are own fighter jets and helicopters because we learned to \"screw\" those Sukhoi fighter jets. It's a different kind of technology that we needed to master. \n\n\u003e Look at Scorpene submarine deal with France, no technology transfer has been received by us.\n\nIn many such kinds of deals (with France and Russia especially) there is an implicit understanding that we indians will try to reverse engineer their technology and they agree to look away in such cases. Their reasoning to do so is simple - they don't perceive a threat from us in the foreseeable future, and they believe that by the time we reverse engineer their current technology they would have further upgraded their technology.","\u003e False. Cryogenic engine technology transfer from Ukraine was stopped on US pressure. Current ISRO cryogenic technology is 100% indigenous. Some of ISRO's rockets did fly with their cryogenic engines, but that was it. \n\nRussia stopped the transfer of technology under US pressure, but they still supplied us the cryogenic engines so we could study and reverse engineer it. How do you think we built our own cryogenic engines? (And no, I am not putting down our scientists - if anybody has tried to reverse engineer anything, you would understand how difficult it is).\n\n\u003e Brahmos is Russian Oniks. It is not a JV. Its ramjet engine is russian made with 0 tech transfer.\n\nBrahmos project involves full scientific and tech transfer. If tomorrow the partnership ends, we can build Brahmos on our own.\n\n\u003e Sukhois are just screwed in India. \n\nAssembling a product also involves a lot of tech transfer that helps builds our engineering skill sets in building such kinds of jets.\n\n\u003e Russia has not helped on GSLV or ICBMs. Total indigenous efforts. We did reverse engineer Scud and built Prithvi, but that was not ICBM.\n\nObviously I am not claiming they gave us everything and we indians didn't do anything. In the GSLV and ICBM projects, the cryogenic engines supplied to us by the Russians, which we reverse engineered and indigenized, is a very important tech in both projects. That is their contribution to it.","\u003e India and russia did not codevelop brahmos. The entire goddamn thing was already in production in Russia.\n\nYeah, just like *Prithvi* missile was in production when *Agni* was being developed! All you are pointing out is that the Russians developed cruise missiles before Brahmos too! \n\nThe Russians agreed to collaborate with us because we had achieved the technical competence to understand cruise missile technology and that is why they partnered with us. And they offered one of their cruise missiles as a platform to develop the Brahmos, which we jointly successfully did while mastering its technology.\n\nIt is just plain fud that India doesn't have access to the technology of Brahmos.","\u003e we did not, and could not, reverse engineer cryogenic engines from russia. were you asleep for the two fricking decades of trial and failure we went through to get it right?\n\nAgain, I do not think you understand how reverse engineering works. \n\nDude, why do you think we failed so many times? Do you think it is easy to reverse engineer something? These failures were \"our stepping stones to success\", as the old adage goes, and **it was because we didn't have the technology transfer of the cryogenic engines** that we faced so many difficulties.\n\nI remember reading an interesting article on reverse engineering in China - an American car manufacturer found that a car launched by a Chinese company was very similar to one of their models and was being sold cheaper. They bought one of these cars to study it, to figure out if any of their IP had been stolen. It became clear that it was an attempt at reverse engineering. One of the things they highlighted was even if it was reverse engineered to work, the Chinese didn't fully understand the science behind some of the things. For example, they had used a metallic bar (or something) to reinforce a part of the car in the front. The Chinese had replaced that with a plastic part as they didn't understand that it was required for enhancing the structural integrity of the vehicle. \n\n**Reverse engineering doesn't mean just copying something but understanding the science and technology behind it.** That is what our indian scientists did with the cryogenic engines. And it is not an easy task nor something to look down upon.","Ukraine forgot one of the governing principles of current world geopolitics - you don't ignore the needs and security of your powerful next door neighbours (unless you are equally powerful). Even India is always conscious of the fact that China and Russia are our powerful neighbours, and we make it quite clear to the west that we will not antagonise them even if we are willing to ally with the west. (That's basically the non-alignment policy that has served us very well).\n\n**Russia has been a most reliable ally of India**, and even threatened the US by openly siding with India during the Bangladesh liberation war when the US tried to intimidate India with their nuclear fleet to end the war with Pakistan (who was their ally).","Read Tim Marshalls book Prisoners of Geography to understand Russian action in Ukraine.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d335e77ba9c57f14063da30"},"flair":"Politics","selftext":"TL;DR: the title\n\nLet me begin by saying that I am not a BJP supporter (Funny how you need to declare it!!). \n\nRight now, every major opposition leader should be working on ground, shunning the ACs and luxury cars to travel on motorbikes/cycles in the summer heat across their constituencies, but nobody is doing it. Almost every oppositions leader is an entitled lazy brat laying their claim for the throne because they are against-Modi. How does that qualify any of these entitled brats for the prime-minister or any minister of India? \n\nMoreover, for people like Tejashwi, his father ran one of the most violent and bloodied government in Bihar. Kidnapping and murder was nothing to be surprised of. Villages have been killed during the Lalu raaj in Bihar. Even today, when Tejashwi addresses media, he uses the word \"tumlog\" for medis, like the media should accept him as the crown prince. The opposition must leave their comfort zone and fight for real problems. If you analyze the polling data, you would be surprised by how the well-established Caste equations of last 20 years just vanished in thin air, onto which the opposition in Bihar was relying on.\n\nI know/believe that this breed of most of the opposition leaders have grown up entitled; hard-work and being humble is not their suite. India needs a new breed of opposition leader, the current cohort of Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh, Tejashwi are not going to make it. \n\nThe big name websites are trying to sweep the elections in few words such as \"Envy and Hate\", \"Dark Soul\", \"Hindutva\", \"polarization\", \"anti-elitism\" and what not.  The victory of BJP is less about these negative connotations for half the voting junta, but more about the sheer amount of hard-work, enthusiasm and energy of ground-cadre. The voters, whose caste-affiliations stood steadfast till 2014-15 have suddenly annihilated that divide. You will find people enthusiastic for Modi everywhere, but most of the Congress supporters doesn't seem to believe in Congress. It was expected that after SP-BSP tie-up, BJP won't get more than 35 seats in UP, but that's not what happened, right?\n\nBJP won UP in last vidhaan-sabha elections and they kept the lead in 2019, but Congress was wiped out of Gujarat, MP, and Rajasthan despite winning there just 6 months ago. Even RaGa had to chide Ashok Gehlot for his putra-moh. How is the lack of initiative and action on oppositions' account makes the voters \"dark-souled\"?\n\nI am sure that violent and extreme Hindutva has not won the country although it may seem so, but the hard-work and sheer modernization of election campaigning in India by BJP has won. Pragya Thakur is a terrorist and she doesn't deserve to sit in Parliament, but the electoral equation of one seat doesn't define the electoral equation of rest of the ~350 seats. \n \nThe day opposition brings in a leader who created an energized ground-cadre, whose advisers know each vidhaan-sabha by emotion and by number, who has visited as many villages as humanely possible, the violent Hindutva will be thrown out the door by same people being accused of \"dark-soul\". Till the time we have this weak and uninspiring opposition, the election machinery of BJP will steer itself to victory whether they support violent Hindutva or not. \n\nLet me add, people wanted Kanhaiya Kumar to win? Why? Because he can talk on TV? If Kanhaiya wants to win, he needs to learn from Smriti Irani. For next 5 years, can Kanhaiya kumar shun the media spotlight, the high-profile speeches and work in Begusarai? Can he visit villages and sleep in dilapidated jhuggi-jhopadis, can he create a network of ground-cadre? Will he stand with people of Begusarai for their problems? Can he fight for the poor, who don't have easy access to clean water, and whom nobody gives any ounce of respect? If he is back to the same media drama and speeches, instead of working his ass off in Begusarai, he was not worthy of a win in 2019 and he will not win in 2024. \n\n\nI hope for a strong opposition and the current state of opposition is pathetic. The journalists should do better than to define almost half a billion voices by one word, they need to tell stories of men and women who are not seduced by violent Hindutva, but still voted for BJP en-masse.","over_18":false,"time":1.559088746e+09,"comments":["true,\n\nOn some show on NDTV they were showing that Amit Shah visited Bengal 70+ times in the last 5 years to rally the base/Workers...\n\nHe Visited All constituencies in India  at least twice..I am not sure rahul baba even visted Amethi, It is a badly run constituency...\n\nJagan walked thousands of Kilometers and visited all panchayats to win Andhra.\n\nLearn something from chikara and Jagan..rahul baba should just go on a padyatra of India or something,  move from your seat, do something.","There was nothing about the opposition that people were looking forward to.Rahul could not deliver 270+ seats.Everyone and their grandmother knew this.You would have ended up with a coalition government at best.I still have nightmares of Third front and it's regional satraps running the Govt as per what benefitted their state best","Everyone here bitches about \"BJP IT Cell\" but at this point, if you don't have a competent IT Cell as a political party, you're not doing your job well. \n\nI was particularly disappointed at the people here lapping up the narrative that BJP won because they had better marketing and more money. As if raising money and getting your message heard are NOT a part of a political party's core job description!","The opposition has been outclassed in strategy and BJP has made them look like analogue politicians in a digital world. \n\nINC was purely relying on their status of \"natural party\" to lead India where once in a while people vote for someone else but after a 5 year term INC is back. \n\nThey had no strategy and were extremely relaxed just \"expecting\" to win because they're congress and a Gandhi was leading the party. \n\nBSP-SP were relying on caste politics which BJP absolutely crushed. We can talk about whatsapp university, media, electoral bonds, etc until the cows come home but the truth is the opposition was completely gassed and had no strategy.\n\nThe fact is BJP had an energised cadre to get the message out where as INC didn't. The leadership needs to change from the top down. Throw out the Gandhis. They might lose another election but it'll be good for the country in the long run.\n\nBJP struggled against regional parties which tells you everything about this election. Regional parties had an ideology, a motivated cadre, and a proper leader.","Opposition especially Congress needs an ideology first something which can provide an alternative to Bjp's hindutva but today the identity of Congress has been reduced to one family they need to expand their horizons.","People here don't want to accept facts. The election wasn't fought and won on just 2 or 3 most discussed factors like TINA, national security and Hindutava, performance factor played a big role. BJP's welfare schemes for example played a very huge role. BJP found a way to deliver somehow and people rewarded. RaGa was willing to give bigger dole than BJP but people still voted for BJP. \n\nOpposition as well as people that want to support the opposition need to realize that elections aren't won on just few issues. This realization hit the media when the results started coming in. You can't win more than 60+ seats again in UP just on the back of Hindutava and nationalism, considering the demography there. Modi and the government had to have done something very right that they captured the popular imagination so well. You shouldn't brush off the win by calling everyone stupid. Hopefully the opposition and their supporters understand the actualities otherwise it's way too easy of a road for BJP going forward.","BJP is far more professional, organized and strategically more powerful as its backed by RSS. They claim they are right wing, but most of their policies are very much left leaning e.g. toilet scheme, electricity scheme, Ujjwala scheme, PM Kisan, Ayushman Bharat, PM Awas Yojana, etc. All of these targeted for poor and worked very well on ground. And their entire team did excellent work on marketing it. Even demonetization \u0026 15L/acct *jhumla* were also part of that game plan. All of this converted into votes! For avg voters' mind, all these schemes are coming from the *Center* and who is at the center?\n\nBJP already preparing for 2024 and they could project AS for the PM's chair if they win in Bengal (2021) \u0026 Delhi (2020) and retain all other state election, particularly UP 2022. I don't think opposition has any unity or any alternative narrative. Congress, being a dead horse, will waste whole 2019 thinking whether to keep RG and then will retain him.","Divya Spandana's AMA over here is enough to understand their incompetence.","There is the TINA factor in LS elections. This time it turned presidential style, which was unexpected. BJP was trying for this for a long time and failed then.\n\nThere is the lazy, unimaginative opposition as you mentioned. They do not have the aggression required. Or even a clear vision or a convincing ability to execute anything.\n\nThere is the hard work factor. But then Gautam Gambhir won. And so did several others who did nothing. So it increases your chances, that's all.\n\nThere is a shift towards the Right way of thinking about the nation. Is it a permanent shift? Perhaps. Probably. Seduced by violence, no. Seduced by the potential for it and the threat posture it presents, of course. You may disagree. For example, stresses and tensions between communities lead to polarisation in most of the country now. (And then there is kerala where such tensions lead to more cohesion among those not seduced by it)\n\nThere is the massive financial advantage BJP enjoyed thanks to electoral bonds.\n\nMedia advantage - the top TV channels are all BJP mouthpieces, the liberal channels are at the bottom end.\n\nJust putting it all out there.","Yogendra Yadav had a good take on the election results (as usual). He refused to peg BJP‚Äôs victory to an acceptance of Hindutva, but rather to the absence of anyone worth paying attention to: ‚Äúif not Modi, then who?‚Äù If I find the link, I‚Äôll edit to add this.\n\nLooking at the results, though, I think there were several people who voted tactically for the Congress. I think my dad did too. This was bad in Delhi, where Atishi Marlena (AAP) pulled in third despite her track record of doing brilliant work for education in Delhi.\n\nDo I think Bhopal condones terrorism? No. I just think people really fucking hated the opposition.","Seriously, what the hell does the average Indian have against air conditioning? Why is using AC considered entitled and derogatory? We are a fucking hot country. Anyone who can use AC should use it if they want to live and work without extra headache. It's not some supreme sacrifice for country to avoid using AC when you can use it.","I don't think Modi succeeded so much as everyone else failed. Why should I if I am not Jatav vote for the BSP, if I am not a Yadav for the Samajwadi. West Bengal has been one of the slowest growing states for decades, despite its high levels of education, and coastal location. Why should I vote for the TMC who has done barely anything for development. What has Rahul Gandhi done besides being born to the right family. Give voters a reason to vote for you, and I think a lot of people will vote against the BJP ad Hindutva.","Totally agree with you about the opposition. This is a wake up call for the opposition. While I feel that NDA was/is the best of the lot in this election, lack of a strong opposition is something I don't like. Democracy can only function with a strong opposition to keep government in check. \n\nIt's very hard to get rid of these dynastic opportunists as the culture of following your parents footsteps is very strongly entrenched. Maybe a couple more defeats like this will allow the true leaders in the opposition to grow and win.","Funny, isn't it? They've always been like that but for the first time in 71 years are people waking up to the realization as if it's a new thing and they deserve every bit of criticism.\n\nHere's an alternative perspective: You are not a Modi supporter (neither am I, I'm a staunch Modi hater more like), but the fact that he won with such a heavy mandate is driving you crazy to the point you're finding satisfaction in blaming the opposition. Why else would you never come up with this argument in the last so many years of Congress' rule? The fact is, they've always been just as lazy, ignorant and useless. But they're bearing the brunt of all leftists' and centrists' abuses **just because** they lost and not because they are lazy, ignorant and useless. Because if you criticize them for these qualities (or lack thereof) of theirs, you should've been voicing this opinion all along. But more people are blaming opposition than ever despite the fact that Rahul Gandhi has actually worked harder than ever this time around to change his image. By no means am I justifying that their lack of efforts, especially compared to BJP's, is a good thing. It's not. But if you look at the face of the opposition, aka Rahul Gandhi, in a vacuum, in isolation, you'd find that his defamation and image-maligning actually prompted him to work harder than ever this time around. Though its still nothing compared to Shah's strategies and his hard work. But that doesn't mean you can discredit him entirely and refuse to recognize it for what it is. But people are still piling up on him and blaming him for Modi's victory. Why? Because of the human tendency to shift the blame. Yes, he is to be blamed but not entirely. The blame goes to the media too, which sold it's soul to the devil and shows nothing but propaganda to the people 24x7, blame goes to the people for not opening up their eyes to see that they're falling for said nationalist propaganda, blame also goes to the Election Commission which publicly approves of blatant violations of the Model Code of Conduct, thereby strengthening the narrative that the Supreme Leader can't ever do anything wrong and when he does it, it automatically becomes right. And of course the BJP itself is responsible for all of this directly in the first place.\n\nAll in all, I understand the salt but please... you're overdoing it just because BJP's hard work overshadowed the opposition's efforts and exposed their laziness in contrast. That DOES NOT mean it's something new. They've always been like that. If anything, they worked harder this time around, at least Rahul did, but it was still not enough. The BJP wave was strong and Rahul's image was damaged irreparably, both thanks to the media. You couldn't counter both of these major issues either before the elections if you were in his shoes. Most people I know, myself included would have given up long ago if we saw the whole country making jokes on us, abusing us, openly name-calling us and defaming our family on the internet using derogatory words, even more so if we were royalty like the Gandhis.\n\nDon't spit on them just to feel better about yourselves. They worked harder than ever this time, just not hard enough.","good one. eloquent piece.  \n\nalso make a mention of family / dynasty -ism in our political parties.  \n\nall the three listed in OP text are family members.  \nin TN: look at DMK : so many family members. 3rd \u0026 4th generation kids are being groomed \u0026 bannered now itself.  \n\nin KA, there's Prajwal Revanna , Sumalatha Ambareesh, Nikhil Kumaraswamy, HD Kumaraswamy,  \n\nin AP, there's Jagan , CBN,   \n\nso many people exist in politics simply coz their grandpa / papa are big names in politics.  \n\nthe partymen need to grow a spine and stop supporting this trend.  \n\nparties need to be truly democratic internally first.  \n\nstop this dy-nasty politics","Opposition fucked up real real bad.\n\nBJP has solid groundwork, and the amount of work they do is monumental.\n\nBut this election has been more about media manipulation.","1) Atishi Marlena - she didnt lose by a narrow margin. \n2) You would stick to your words if the media was neutral?

While borrowing heavily from the UK, our Constitution framers did not take into account the fact that while the average constituency in the UK was about 375 sq. km in size with about 50,000 voters, an average Indian constituency would have over twenty times that number, at over 1.3 million voters, spread over a much larger geographical area.* \n\n*An MP in a Ladakh constituency would need to cover 173,266 sq. km which could take several weeks. A single constituency in Arunachal Pradesh with an area of 40,572 sq. km would require many days of trekking to reach its far-flung outposts.*\n\n*To make matters more complex, each constituency, since 1971, has had to vote twice‚Äîonce for parliament and once for the state assembly. Given the size and the number of voters involved, and earmarking a spend of even a few rupees per voter, the conclusion reached was that unrealistic ceiling limits had been placed from the start.* \n\n*During an election campaign, the average MP in India would need to depend on workers familiar with the terrain. They, in turn, would have to harness a small army of workers, most of whom would require to be paid, fed and possibly housed during the pre-election and campaign periods. Many MPs whom I have since met have complained bitterly about how unrealistic the Commission is about the real costs of a campaign.*\n\nThe money has to come from somewhere, and it doesnt come for free. What is the solution? How about rationalising constituency sizes?

Copy pasting from my own comment elsewhere.\n\n\u003e My understanding is that in general, the majority of Kerala were against the Sabarimala judgment. Irrespective of their religions.\n\n\u003e However, he/she also understood that it was a SC order and so had to be implemented.\n\n\u003e BJP's and RSS' methods of protesting and blockading created serious resentment among a lot of people, who would have otherwise supported them IF they had behaved gently. But their methods alienated even those who were against the judgment. Add to that Sridharan Pillais comment about golden opportunity or something, and a widespread awareness that BJP at the Center could at least temporarily make an ordinance work, and was not doing it.\n\n\u003e So now there was support for the issue but irritation against BJP. And a realisation that BJP is trying the same emotional issue stunt that it has tried in the rest of India often leading to violence and bloodshed. (and don't forget that RSS-BJP widely alienated people during the floods)\n\n\u003e Now I come to CPM.\n\n\u003e People loved the leadership of Pinarayi during the floods. They disliked his handling of the Sabarimala issue. What was the difference?\n\n\u003e You had a gentler, friendlier Pinarayi during the floods. He was leading with a smile, and people appreciated that. However, his handling of the Sabarimala issue looked confrontational. Basically, people felt that the issue should be handled sensitively and carefully - or at least, more humility was needed during this period. Pinarayi is easy to dislike when he is in typical Pinarayi mode.\n\n\u003e Now add all of this together. Who would people vote for? You are Hindu / Christian / Muslim and you don't want SC to interfere in religious stuff. But you are also worried about BJP inroads. You are irritated by what you see as an attitude of the govt that is as provocative and confrontational as the BJP-RSS.\n\n\u003e So you vote UDF.\n\n\u003e Yes, Modi and BJP provided ample justification to consider BJP a worry this time. However, if the BJP opts for a more toned down campaign in Kerala, a lot more people may vote for them. And the anti BJP consolidation won't be so strong either for an Assembly election. However, has Pinarayi pissed off enough people already and are they recoverable? Can't say. Would people go back to voting as usual during Assembly elections, with only minor tactical voting to keep BJP at bay? Can't say. But I believe Pinarayi has frittered away the goodwill generated during the floods.","I would prefer Rahul over a hateful, uneducated genocidal Maniac, The guy you are praising literally believes Ganesh had a plastic surgery.

Allow me to elaborate.\n\nI see a lot of similarities between Trump and Modi. I won't go into the details, just Google it basically, and you'll probably get an enhanced list of similarities. In the US, rednecks and bigots support Trump. But the press has still maintained it's freedom for the large part. Why is that? It's because their education system is solid i.e. practicality-centric. Both the media and the audience are, in large part, educated enough to have logical reasoning and ethical distinguishing abilities. In India, the theory-centric education system ensures that grades are prioritized, not the education itself. Further damage is done by corruption, casteism and reservations that start from college level onwards and stay with every Indian for the rest of their lives. They make sure that the person doesn't wise up at all even after leaving the school. Apart from that, the don't-question-your-elders concept of our culture plays a huge role in keeping us stupid. Basically, at home, you can't question your parents, at school, you can't question the teacher, at job, you can't question the boss and when you come home and go out to vote, you keep in mind that you can't question your political leaders. This devoids everyone of having an intellectual conversation and seriously hampers open, honest conversations in our society. The politicians know this. That's why they never work on getting the education system right. So that you stay stupid, and can be easily distracted by boogiemen like Pakistan, endangerment of Hindutva, opposition parties conspiring to destroy India so that you don't question why are we still lacking the most basic amenities and human rights in two thousand fucking nineteen. They know that you can be made fools out of from an early age. When you're students. If they strengthen that part of your life, you'll start voting them out because then you'll grow up to be educated enough to understand this.\n\nNeedless to say, the propaganda-feeders, the media of our country, and the propaganda-consumers, the audience, are all too naieve because of the fucked up education system. And as long as that doesn't change, nothing in this country would change.","What‚Äôs new about this?

We are so heavily dependent on BSNL that a life without them at this point seems unimaginable to me. \n\nLet me put this into perspective, while a large chunk of BSNLs business is consumer centric, an extremely large chunk is business to business. \n\nAt the moment some of their largest clients in the country are large organizations like SBI, IDBI, HPCL, BPCL, ONGC, etc and in the private sector as well. BSNL has an extremely large reach in terms of their links which allow these state run and privately run businesses to connect their IT infrastructure. These links are MPLS links, P2P links, ILL links, broadband, VSAT, etc. Basically anything that allows the users/employees to connect to the organizations core datacentre. \n\n\nThe reasons for this are:\n\nA. Afaik it's easy for PSU's to give business to BSNL because they don't have to go through a very time consuming RFP process and orders can be directly placed onto BSNL\n\nB. BSNL has an unimaginable reach. They exist in places where frankly no one else does. It could be the Himalayas or the North East or Thar or whatever. BSNL is basically everywhere. Where nothing exists, you'll still find BSNL. What this means is that sometimes, they are frankly the only option for many businesses that have a remote presence in tier 3 or tier 4 cities or even villages. It is very rare to find a private player like tcl, sify or vodafone in these areas. Thus businesses have no option but to work with BSNL. \n\nSo BSNL is a mammoth which basically is providing a very crucial service to our nation. And at the same time, BSNL not existing is a very dangerous scenario because: \n\nA. Many many places will go unserviced because they just won't have connectivity. Without connectivity it'll be very difficult for the businesses to operate in those areas. Example: a SBI ATM won't be able to connect to the core data center. If it can't connect, it won't be able to access information, thus won't be able to perform it's operations meaning that it won't dispense money, or show the balance, etc because it just won't have the ability to get that information. The people living in these areas will suffer badly. Imagine a poor migrant worker sending money home but their family not being able to take the money from the machine or from the branch. \n\nB. If BSNL goes out of business, most organizations will have a mammoth task of changing their links from BSNL to another player like Tata or Sify or Airtel. Changing one single link takes around 1.5 months of processing time. Sometimes more. Imagine changing hundreds of thousands at the same time. It'll be chaos, prices will go up a lot, and we just won't be able to service it. It's an extremely daunting task. We'll be lucky if we are able to change a small percentage of the links. This will definitely have an operational as well as heavy commercial impact\n\nAlthough I would say that with the improvements in technology and the pervasiveness of Reliance Jio, this scenario could be countered. However it will still be extremely difficult because 4G technology just isn't that trustworthy at the moment in India. It's better than nothing granted but it's really not that great. We're going for near perfection in our operations whereas 4G comes with basically no guarantees. It's an extremely large drop in quality of service levels despite the party being compared to being BSNL. And it also doesn't change the fact that infrastructure will have to be changed at a very large scale. Simply because most places that'll be affected arent geared at all for 4G. They just don't meet the minimum requirements to be able to use 4G technology because most of their routers aren't capable of using 4G. Cisco has now started producing these 4G capable routers but most remote locations don't have these and thus will require a change in the device. \n\nSo if BSNL goes out of business, which it just might cos it's debt is really just that high and it's a very poorly run business albeit a critical one but still a poorly run business, we'll be in a world of pain. I hope the government makes some reforms which aid the situation. Or even better I wish a private player takes them over for their existing operations although considering how much debt the telecom sector already has, I doubt any player would want to take on BSNL's as well. It's just really damn high. \n\n\nTo sum it all up, imagine demonitization but now it affects not just the banking industry but also oil, health, education, public services, etc. It's painful to even think about it.\n\nEdit: Removed the part about other telcos taking bandwidth from BSNL.","[deleted]","Why are all government businesses failing?!","BSNL has more than 1.6 lakh employees - no government, not even this one has the guts to do that. There'll be unimaginable rioting, so I think this story is rushing to conclusions. Any shut down will have to happen over twenty plus years, they are still closing down Hindustan photo films, which has been a terrible loss maker for 40+ years.\n\nBSNL has found itself unable to retain talented engineers who get trained at the government's expense for 5 years, only to have Airtel poach them or see them get bent and start to profit off contracts.\n\nAs others have said all PSUs and Banks depend on BSNL - it is not going anywhere, so calm down.","Motabhai to the rescue ü§ë","They were making operating profit in 2014 and 15, with the entry of Jio it started making loss.

BSNL has been losing customers, many of them due to poor customer service. I know some older people who desperately wanted to hang on to their BSNL connections, but finally gave up in frustration because of the attitude of the employees. I have had occasion to go to BSNL offices, and they treat you very poorly. I believe, if the frontline employees had be more customer friendly, they would have retained many more customers and wouldn't have been in this place in the first place. They had the advantage of having the customer base, and it was theirs to lose - which they did.","They should have been the number 1 broadband and telephone company in India but they ruined everything.

They should have been privatized then and there. \n\nAnyone who wants to support BSNL and its shoddy service should be made to do so out of their own pockets instead of forcing taxpayer to bear the burden by 'injecting' thousands of crores every year to cover its debts.\n\nWhat you're seeing now is a government which can't / doesn't want to privatize these perpetual loss-makers has decided to just stop covering their losses, so now they're out of money to continue operations and face a shutdown. This is what happened to a few other PSUs like Hindustan Machine Tools in Modi-1.","[removed]","This is overhyped and very inaccurate","mark my words, will be sold to JIO at a throwaway price.","The only decent isp we have in my area is bsnl.

The JIO got more than 6 months. The main agenda of JIO is to get monopoly and state the rules in telecom. For this since 2016 Govt of India is helping them. First time in India the PM became brand ambassador of a private company (JIO, Narendra Modi) and secondly, they are given over 1.15 Lac car loan from public sector banks and have assets less than 25000 Cr. In this scenario, if JIO succeeds, they will monopolize the telecom sector. This seems very less. So if they fail, then under bankruptcy INDIAN BANKS will face the real loss. The question should be why Navrattan companies who used to give Indian Govt loans till 2014 have suddenly started failing?","\u003e Has any private teleco gotten a 10,000 crore loan?

What a mess. This should have been done back in the 70s.","\u003e What great world class service did they provide?\n\nI think you are too young to remember what actually happened.  \n\nHave you ever noticed why Indian sectors are highly staggered? As in some domains are way in the lead while others are barely even relevant.  \nTelecom was/is among those which post 80s had a head start (outside of the Green Revolution and all that, this has to do with Post Primary sector trajectory).  \nCommunications is Connective Infra, it is critical and do you remember Sukh Ram?  \nHe was the Union Minister responsible under which India basically connected itself through this domain.  \nHe was mindbogglingly corrupt, no doubt about that but it was under him this thing happened.  \n\nYou have forgotten about it because (it seems from your comment) you are too young and haven't seen how this field opened up.  \nPublic sector led the work, Private players were provided a platform and then normal economic engine takes care of the thing and corruption as well whereby a PSU like BSNL got neutered by constantly getting 2nd fiddled and lower over the years because Private players kept becoming too influential and working with Politicians and lobbying for certain things.  \n\n4G is not an outlier, it is a blatant norm example/analogy.  \nWithout BSNL's DataOne country would have been stuck in Dial-up for more years. For like a decade country essentially had only 1 choice for wired broadband.  \n\nAll this happened despite it being heavily constrained in its work flow by the authorities. Had it been allowed a free reign like Chinese telecoms got, it would have become a Global heavyweight and that is NOT a joke.  \n\nBSNL was counted among the 9 Jewel PSU's of the country because of how important it was and how much it was helping with progress.  \nBut it was always hampered by Govt's internal nonsense.  \nThis Huawei BS that is coming up again with 5G, it happened like 10-12 years back as well with Telecom equipment and Govt tenders, where Huawei and ZTE were not given enough space to operate (for mundane reasons because it is not like they were banned, they were everywhere anyway just haphazardly distributed) and that too delayed India's broadband proliferation.  \n\nAnd if you are calling for what did BSNL do before 90s, well there isn't they could have done much, technology stack at a global level wasn't that developed and even less in an Indian context. See what China had in 80s in this space, they were even behind us.  \n\nBSNL can hardly be blamed for this, however for things like other Connective Infra, Rail and Roads, absolutely one can blame those PSU departments, they basically sat on their backs and held the country back because Literally no country in human history develops without having a connective Infra of Roads. India tried to prove it could, it doesn't work, it is almost a Law.  \n\nIndia is having its Road moment now, in the last 8 years or so, what should have happened decades ago. That is on the Govt and those departments not on BSNL and its domain.","When jobs and livelihood are on the line can you blame them?  \n\nWe can only make a judgement on this if these people were allowed a freer reign to do their thing and compete. \n\nAllow BSNL to work like a private company, let there be higher accountability. Let there is bonus system for employed from top to down and remove the life long Job safety dynamic.

Not everyone works for profit, dude. People will be more than willing to contribute to the community if the community ensures they get the resources they need to be productive.

People in public departments feel they are doing just another job for money and don't feel the pride in improving the community/systems. This disenchantment with work in a capitalist system is well understood amongst communists. I also heard in an interview by Atishi of AAP where she mentioned that teachers are celebrated for their service with posters and shit and that improved the morale and led to better results. People want to succeed, but when we tie their success to something trivial as the amount to money they accumulate over their lifetime, things go wrong.

Air India is the national airline of India. **The aircraft is operated as VIP flight by the Indian Air Force (IAF). The IAF's Air Headquarters Communication Squadron, based at Indira Gandhi International Airport (formerly Palam Air Force Base) in New Delhi, is in charge of operating these aircraft.**\n\nAs for the USAF managing Air Force one by itself, well, that's a dedicated VIP aircraft. In a stark contrast, and I quote again so you can properly read this time:\n\n\u003e Air India One (also referred to as AI-1 or AIC001) is the call sign of **any aircraft with the Prime Minister or President of India on board**.\n\nMeaning they don't have a dedicated carrier for any prominent Government VIP which they call Air India One. It's just a fleet of slightly modified aircraft which may get the code assigned to them. The whole concept, which you're comparing to Air Force One, is different. That's why it doesn't work here the same way you're demanding.","Because JIO is favored by MODI Govt.

A drop from 2.6 to 1.9 within a span of 7 years is reasonable, and is not inconsistent with a drop seen in other states.\n\nAgain, I'm talking about absolute numbers so I'm not sure what your point about rankings or weirdly sourced numbers was. Uttarakhand's absolute TFR/TFR improvement are also consistent with HDI numbers, literacy rate, HIV awareness etc, so 2.6-\u003e1.9 is consistent with that, rather than being an outlier."],"permalink":"/r/india/comments/ccoydb/tamil_nadu_is_the_only_indian_state_that_is/","author":"Stoicpeace","title":"Tamil Nadu is the only Indian state that is expected to see a decline in population in 2041 after reaching its peak in 2031.","distinguished":null,"upvote_ratio":0.96,"score":168}

These practices escalated during World War II to include non-judicial incarceration, confiscation of property, forced labor, sexual slavery, medical experimentation, and death through overwork, undernourishment, and execution through a variety of methods, with the genocide of different groups as the primary goal.\n\nAccording to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), the country's official memorial to the Holocaust, \"The Holocaust was the murder of six million Jews and millions of others by the Nazis and their collaborators during World War II.\" The museum puts the total number of murdered during the Holocaust at 17 million: 6 million Jews and 11 million others.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot\u0026message=Excludeme\u0026subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","I did nazi that.","Aligned to what-- it would still be symmetrical.","eh fair enough","Mammi dategi mujhe :(","NCERT has a whole chapter on it in 9th standard.

Women have lower sex drive is a myth. It was propagated to keep women under leash. It was also propagated to justify multiple marriages by men. It was used to suppress their sexuality. When women showed their normal sexual desires, men denounced them to be witches for having more than normal sex drive. Unfortunately, many men fall for this nonsense. Men talk openly with aeach other about their sexual life. They do not talk to women about their sexual life. So, it is a grey area for them. So, they slurp up whatever nonsense other men write or dish out to them in gossips and shitty debonair type magazines. I came across only one woman with lesser sex drive than me. She was an Indian. I live in Europe. Here, I have hardly come across any woman who does not have high appetite for sex. It has to do with the society. More a society is open, better the women are in communicating their sexual desires and fantasies. If you keep them behind ghunghat and veil, their sexuality erodes away. You cannot judge all the women of the world by seeing or sleeping with one or two women from India. Indian men have an aversion to condoms. That does not mean you start thinking that men all over the world hate condoms. Women in India do not like anal sex much. That does not mean women all over the world dislike anal sex.

When the promos for The Office (India) came out, I decided to remain positive among all the haters. The fact remains that even The US Office did terrible in its first season, trying to emulate the UK original. It's only after the 2nd season, where they tweaked it to their humor that it grew into one of the best shows ever.\n\nSo coming to the Indian one. I patiently waited until midnight for the show to drop and fired it up immediately. Here are some impressions. For people who have never seen The Office (US) these will be SPOILERS. For the fans of the show, these will be inside jokes. (I'd love to be a part of one someday)\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\n1. They used a new title track and quite frankly, it is meh. Maybe a Scranton 7.\n2. Indian Pam is cute af. Great casting. Also, her name is .... wait for it.. Pammi! (Identity theft is not a joke!)\n3. Desi Toby is annoying af. Because he overacts to the moon. OG Toby was annoying because he hardly emoted. This guy toh bhai. NO GOD NO!\n4. Jagdeep Chadda aka Desi Michael Scott does a really good job! He's not tried to be Michael Scott and this works for him.\n5. Oscar is a great cast as well! I'm only like 90% sure of this though, but I believe Oscar in the Indian version is a guy named Chinchin, who looks like he's from the North East but is actually from Karkardooma, East Delhi (there's a pretty funny scene in the second episode, **Diversity Day**). Again, I'm not entirely sure this is Oscar (he isn't wearing fabulous, bright-colored clothes you know) but it does fit the bill!\n6. Remember how they changed the title track? Well, everything else is pretty much a straight-up carbon copy from the US show. The office layout, desi Phyllis who is always knitting. I wonder if Bob Vance is gonna be Bunty BlueStar, BlueStar refrigeration.\n7. The episodes are 95% scene to scene remakes with the jokes tweaked for Indian audience. (Jello isn't a thing here, so Dwight's stapler is in something else) Having watched the US show easily over 10 times, I knew each scene before it took place.\n8. \\*\\*Two of the shows longest standing and most memorable jokes, Asst to the regional Manager, and Thats What She Said (TWSS).\\*\\*I was very eager to see how they'd play Asst to the regional manager. I was very disappointed. It took me 2 takes to actually understand the indian version. i won't be surprised if you miss it the first time. TWSS hasn't turned up yet (only 2 epis down.) but big things usually take time. That's what she said.\n9. This is my most favorite topic. Many have discussed how, if The Office (US) aired exactly today, it would face endless backlash for the blatant stereotyping, the misogyny, the racism (all by Michael Scott), and would never get more than 2 seasons in todays political climate. The Indian one is taking a huge gamble by repeating the same tropes. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely stand by it in the form of art. But I won't be surprised to see pitchforks and a Twitter Army assembling.\n\nThe first episode is free to watch and available at : [https://www.hotstar.com/tv/the-office/s-2187/welcome-to-wilkins-chawla/1260007027](https://www.hotstar.com/tv/the-office/s-2187/welcome-to-wilkins-chawla/1260007027)  (thanks, u/ppatra)","over_18":false,"time":1.561691403e+09,"comments":["I don't think the show ever makes excuses for Michael Scott's racism or sexism or overall unwokeness. There are plenty of such characters in today's television as well. \n\nWhenever Michael Scott does something racist to Darrell, it's not Darrell or his race, which is the joke. It's Michael Scott.","I watched first 15 minutes while rushing for Office (hehe) and I liked it. I have also seen the US version multiple times and knew the scenes beforehand. I feel they have done a good job so far. Casting is decent. Also some jokes are tweaked for Indian audience. It clearly shows they are respecting the source material and not murdering it. Can't wait to watch it completely.\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nAlso Amit (Jim's counterpart) is having similar huge nose like Jim lol. Were they specifically looking for someone who has similar nose?

Storyline is same as the US one so I knew exactly what's gonna happen.

If anyone hasn't watched the US version then it's gonna be fun. \n\nI wish they move the storyline to something original like what happened with the US one. Even if that doesn't happen I'm gonna wait eagerly for the wedding scene. üòÑ","What do you mean OG show? Gervais/Merchant version is the OG.","Should i watch if i haven't watched the American one?","The first season of the office (US) is really awkward when you watch it for the first time. However it is amazing when you have the whole series and rewatch it again. I hope people give a bit of leeway to shows like these if we really want our television standards to improve.","I want to see who they cast for Creed.","2nd episode was good. 3rd one \"You are anti-national!!\" that was funny. Glad to see writers are pretty woke about subjects.","Good job OP. I was waiting for someone to do a quick review. Thanks!\nDo they have the hahaha background whenever there is a funny moment? That would ruin it for me completely.","That's what she said = Baby bhi yei Boli","Well, this is slightly off-topic but if anyone is interested in watching the OG Indian take on The Office, you should definitely check out [Better Life Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuckmJTahU\u0026list=PLFM6PquCUdebrv_iQmSHlQwOERwsFCPA2).","I had watched the trailer, and wasn't outraged like the majority of the people. I found the trailer to be alright, and more importantly, I know that I fell I love with The Office US after watching multiple seasons, so it's just plain wrong to judge it on a trailer or even the initial episodes. I am giving it a benefit of doubt. \n\nHowever, I am not sure if I like the fact that Desi Office is scene be scene recreation of the original.\n\n\u003eMany have discussed how, if The Office (US) aired exactly today\n\nYes you are right, I think it was the director or producer that said that the Office would not do well in the contemporary political\\ social climate in USA.\n\nLastly, you didn't talk about desi Dwight? Was the actor good?","I liked the first episode. I didn't like The Office(US) in its first season and didn't understand the fan following behind it. But around season 2 , it became a part of my life. Hoping the same for our version. For many series the first 3-4 episodes are kinda meh but when the dust is settled , we appreciate the story,acting and a hundred other things, so let's give time to our version. Indian Micheal was good, I'm already sold on Pammi, I've followed Dwight's actor since TVF and like his acting and hope he gives justice to Dwight's character in the future. Jim was also good. Jan was ok, can't wait for Jan and Micheal to get busy! Rest all other characters need time to flesh out. Hoping a new wave of Indian comedies finishes Tarak Mehta and other such \"comedy\" shows. Time will tell.","I'm a couple of episodes down and I really like it, I love the Indianisms they've brought to the table, not to mention a much more familiar setting makes it feel more personal and close to heart. I'm one happy camper this weekend.","It's really good according to Indian Standards. Let's stop comparing it to the US version and give it a chance atleast. It's funnier than most Indian sitcoms and I'd probably watch the whole season today.","Pammi pammi aur uske pamme üòç","I would give you gold, if had some. But this is exactly I was looking for, because I don't know if I should watch the Indian version or not. Who is Dwight Schrute in the Indian Version?","**Positives**\n\nPam\n\nMichael\n\nRyan\n\n**Meh**\n\nJim\n\nPhyllis\n\nOscar\n\nKevin\n\n**Negatives**\n\nDwight\n\nAngela\n\nStanley\n\nThe theme\n\nI have only watched the first episode so far","People are being too critical of this adaptation IMO. I've only watched the first ep as I don't have Hotstar VIP, but honestly it is something I would watch. \nTheir whole idea behind making Dwight an Rss or nationalist tyoe of guy is fucking amazing but the actor needs to do better.\n\nJim is spot on, closed followed by Pam(mi)\n\nIndian Michael needs to get into the groove a bit and I think he'll do better in coming episodes (no way to know that as I don't have VIP)","I enjoyed the episodes. But I enjoyed your review more.","What about Oscar?","Pammis favorite ice cream flavor is Jamun. Why. \n\nI love the office so much and I was hugely sceptical about the hotstar version. I was dissapointed with the first episode since they were just the same jokes with little tweaks. The jokes that chaddha doesn't seem too scott-esque at all. I don't see myself growing to gradually love this guy. But I hope that the next few episodes ( or seasons) grow further away from the same US version jokes and into its own thing. I guess we'll see. The general public needs to kinda take a deep breath and maybe give this a try. All I see are Micheal Scott gifs saying \"Nooooo\" eevrywhere on social media. \n\nI still don't love this. Nor do I hate it.","I just finished watching the entire series and here‚Äôs what I noticed\n\n1) Every joke was literally just translated in Hindi and thats it. Few indian regional joke are good tbh. The most memorable jokes are literal translations eg. ‚Äúbaby ne bhi yahi bola‚Äù . Some translations makes you go mad eg. ‚Äúechak daana echak daana‚Äù, like really ?\n\n2) I exactly knew what was coming next, even the expressions.\n\n3) Jagdeep Chaddha doesn‚Äôt try to be exactly like Micheal Scott is a catch. Character of Dwight is not exactly same , its been fed with indian values which will appeal and connect to regional audience.\n\n4) Angela Kevin and Stanley characters are just meh . Ryan‚Äôs storyline is a bit changed. But again the scenes are same which doesn‚Äôt make sense eg .(SPOILER) If he is nephew of the owner why is he doing car cleaning or bringing food in the morning, i agree he is an intern but during his introduction Chadda gives a look that suggests even though intern he has to respect him a bit because of his relation. Simply that arc doesn‚Äôt make sense.\n\n5) Storyline changed a bit it will turn out great if properly thought into.\n\nOverall it‚Äôs good for people who didn‚Äôt watch The Office US , for that show fans a bit saddening. But it doesn‚Äôt let you down. Though Indianised it holds its roots quiet well. IMO ,give it a try.","Watched the first episode. I don‚Äôt really like the guy playing Dwight, he‚Äôs kinda meh. Pam is surprisingly good, Jan did a little overacting, Micheal was also decent. Jim was okay as well, but in the first episode, I got the feeling that he despises Michael which isn‚Äôt really the case in the US office. He tolerates him and kinda makes fun of him.","Regarding point 9, even Friends wouldn't survive in this day and age for its depiction of lgbt community and sexism. Friends in this day and age would create massive Twitter shitstorm.","From whatever I saw, it was really mediocre. I mean, I obviously didn't expect amazing quality but it's quite average leaning on to bad. Pammi and Amit trying to be cute and all seems so forced. Specially Pammi. Amit gives off a very thug vibe (by appearances). Chadda feels like he's trying to channel Amir Khan (circa Andaaz Apna Apna) in all, if not most of his lines.","What are the odds of Kelly's equivalent being a dark, ugly, dumb south Indian? I'd say 1/1.","Chadda doesn't seem to be as cringe worthy/laddish as David Brent. A lot of humour is lost that way.\n\nIn that jelly joke, Gareth doesn't like jelly and that's why that joke works.\n\nAlso Pammi is too pretty for the role, Dawn Tinsley wasn't that pretty. In fact all the actors feel too well groomed.\n\nDoes Faridabad have same reputation of Slough as a dreary and crap town?\n\nAgain just like the US remake, it loses all the charm of the original.","I haven't seen the show. But what pissed me of with the trailer itself is that even the architecture of the Office has been carbon copied. Oh, can't we at least present how an Indian Office would look like. I am not interested in seeing Carbon Copy as I might as well see another run of the original. What I would expect are Indian issues told in a comic way but I believe the creators lack any imagination whatsoever. I will pass this one.","This review seems like an ad for the show to be honest. Well done marketing.","I liked Jim (Amit) a lot. Cute.","How is desi kevin though?","I thought Indian Michael Scott was overacting tbh. Looking at the episode list it seems like they're copying the US show too much. Not sure I'll watch it fully.","This is a decent trend. A couple of year ago, there was Sumit Sambhal lega, a clone of Everybody Loves Raymond. Transferred very well to Indian culture and I think worked very well. One of very few shows I have enjoyed on Indian TV.","Pretty much sums up what I felt about the show (saw 3 episodes). Many of the jokes don't work, but it's not as cringe worthy as I thought it'll be.","\u003eChinchin\n\nI recently came to know the meaning of this word in Japanese. Can't stop laughing whenever I hear it now.","I did not get the Assistant Regional Manager Cast? what is the joke here?","Pretty sure that the North East guy is Kelly and Oscar is the Muslim guy.\n\nAnd I think they merged Stanley and Kevin into one unit - the Cochin guy.\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nOther than these differences, I'm amazed by how ridiculously similar to the US version the casting is. You can tell which character is which just by looking at them.","How are the Indian versions of Stanley, Kevin and Creed? Always felt they were the funniest characters on the show, especially Kevin.\n\nShows like these also depend heavily on the chemistry of the actors. If there is no chemistry, no amount of good writing can save it","I've just watched the first half of the first episode. And I felt the desi micheal scott is trying to mimic the mimics who mimic aamir khan, (dae?). (Boman Irani would've been a great choice IMHO). Dwight's desitization was spot on! Pammi was OK. No issues there. \nI kiiind of liked it and will continue to watch. \n\nAll the best to the makers.","UK version is the best though.","What was the assistant to the regional manager joke in this. Tell us. With a spoiler redact if you wish.","i have watched us office one time. I loved it. I watched the first episode of the new show on hotstar. liked it a lot. Funny to hai. Only thing was the costume and office was too much star plus type. it could have been a little desi or a little more real i guess. its way better than the tarak mehta crap we have on sony.","I'd be up for a gauhar khan affair with chadda and her eventual mental health issues. \n\nPammi evolving would be fun as well.\n\nDesi Angela and Karen from other office are going to be major major disappointments if not executed perfectly.","Just realized the main characters from the US version, who are missing:\n\nMeredith Palmer\nCreed Bratton\nKelly Kapoor üòí","The writers did a good job of converting the show to the Indian context, but I can't help but feel the acting is plain TERRIBLE. Except for a few like Pammi, TP, and Amit.","Why is no one talking about desi Roy? I liked that cast, could have been a little more subtle though, but still like that guy.","It's pure BS. Why is hotstar ripping off US,UK series and making a exact Hindi copy! It's was irritating to core!","Me likey.

I didn't need to know this exists. This is probably how the British felt when the American series came out.","I haven't watched it yet. So, I cannot give you my opinion on it although, I know it will be a tatti. Gauhar Khan is the only reason I am going to watch it. Let's see.","At the time, I don't think it ever needed to.

Dude is just overacting). Pammi is a perfect fit. Her acting as a mild, simple girl just wondering what her life is, is spot on!","-------Hotshotgg","\u003eIf anyone hasn't watched the US version then it's gonna be fun.\n\nI'm not so sure about this. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Indian audience has always relied on a laugh-track to cue humor. This sort of dry-humor is not something that will be appreciated right away, imo. Could it be possible people like you and me are only enjoying this because we have seen the scenes before and so subconsciously we are laughing at the OG scenes?","My bad. yes, Gervais/merchant will always be the OG. But in terms of mainstream popularity/acceptance I think US version tops the list. But credit to the OG UK Show. Will make it explicit.","I'd say watch the US one first.","I would say you watch office in this order. \nIndian \u003e uk \u003ejapanese\u003e and finally US office. In this way you would experience better quality content.","I would like to see \"Chicha\" from The pitchers.","No, they've stuck to the same original mockumentary format. No annoying background laughter or any of those pathetic \"funny\" sounds like toinggggg.","I was looking for this comment....\nOhh and I think they have taken down that show after the whole aib controversy","Dwight was a disappointment to me. Which is why I didn't say much. IMO Dwight is one of the most important characters after Michael, in the OG series. In this version he seems tooo over the top. Agreed even US Dwight was a jackass, beet-loving, farmer who had weird customs and traditions. Even the Indian Dwight has them, but for some reason I feel Desi Dwight is kuch zyaada hi, as compared to US Dwight, even though US Dwight himself was kuch zyaada hi, but it worked! I don't know how else to explain it.","\u003eI know that I fell I love with The Office US after watching multiple seasons, so it's just plain wrong to judge it on a trailer or even the initial episodes. \n\nThis!! My first run of the series was 10 years ago. Just one run and that's it. Sometime around 5 years ago I started watching it again, and it's been on endless loop ever since.","Yeah TMKOC had its run. Now its time for some new stuff..","Pammi pammi mere baccho ke mummy.","TP! Triveni Prakash :D","Dwight is negative? That dude makes the show for me. Also he is pretty famous comedic actor","first episode was bad honestly. 2nd one was good.","Hahah thank you! :D","Ohh Oscar is a  great cast as well! I'm only like 90% sure of this. But I believe Oscar in the Indian version is a guy named Chinchin, who looks like he's from the North East but is actually from East Delhi (there's a pretty funny scene in the second episode, Diversity Day). Again, I'm not entirely sure this is Oscar, but it does fit the bill!","Considering the episode titles are the same as the US ones, I don't see them veering too far off from the plot. Maybe some side-plots might be introduced. I'm all in for giving the show a complete viewing. I almost gave up on the US Office after the first season. Sticking on has led me to now having watched it at least 10 times (I always skip the first though)","I watched the first 2 episodes. In US version Dwight being a farmer may very well work in this version. Also why they change his character from law respecting person to a goon. I didn't like it.","I feel the same about Dwight. Seems very over-acting. Love Pam!! I want to see how they develop the tangential characters like Phyllis/Stanley/Ryan/Kelly (white woman maybe?)\n\nIndian shows are not used to having more than 1 or max 2 central characters. While The Office still had Scott as the central figure, all the other characters had very strong character arcs. Hope they do the same here and not limit it to Jim/Pam/Michael","And I completely disagree with point 9. I mean\n always sunny has its 14th season coming this September . Which is on a whole another level of offensive jokes than friends ever will be","What?\n\nFriends is one of the most wholesome show around.\n\n\nThat's why its clone HIMYM survived.","Absolutely agree. There's very little characters can get away with today in the name of acting. Have you seen the video by Johnathan Pie where he calls out the stupid identity politics we have to deal with today? it's a masterpiece.","Your observations on Pammi and Amit are absolutely spot-on with mine. Their act does seem a bit forced, especially keeping in mind that almost all of their target audience would be the US show's fans (where Jim and Pam were naturals from day one, and IMO, masters at camera- conscious reactions). Amit needs to inculcate a subtle layer of innocent hesitance to his character (I'm not showing off, it took me 10 mins to actually pen down just this sentence based on how I feel), which used to up the likeability factor for Jim.\n\n\nI'm still not clear on whether I like Chaddha's act (I'm a couple of episodes in). Maybe it's psychological- I seem to have in mind how The Office (US) had a typically cringey Michael in the first season, then the producers actually worked on making his Michael more likeable, taking cues from Steve's character in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. \n\nMishra (Dwight) seems to be a bit overkill. They have pretty much nailed the character traits given the Indian scene (also the actor they chose is very talented), but he needs to be tuned down like 10 percent or so. \n\nAll being said, I do see myself finishing the first season, whether I like it or not.","What is a hindi show without degrading South Indians.. Kevin is that South Indian here.. I can't even imagine how much shit that character is going to get.. In the 2nd episode, I felt the director's / producers urge to troll South Indians through the mouth of Jagdeep Chadda..","I was hoping it would be a white chick, or realistically speaking, maybe Bangladeshi/Pakistani. Would love to see what angle they take there.","Original doesn't feel like a sitcom which is its USP. The grey walls, harsh fluorescent lighting - all that adds to the documentary format. And you feel sad for Brent which is an additional layer on top of the cringe comedy.\n\nThe American version is good but is too TV show*y*.","\u003eI believe the creators lack any imagination whatsoever\n\nI disagree with this. They have tried to tweak the characters and the dialogues to cater to the Indian audience. Yes, the architecture is exactly the same, but that'd probably be because the creators thought it'd be better that way, and not because they lacked creativity.","Hahahah well I'm a big fan of the US show so I might be biased, but that being said, I've pointed both good and bad aspects of the show.","I'm very impressed with the casting! Amit and Pammi seem nailed on for the roles. Desi Toby was a let down, as well as Desi Stanley Hudson (Saleem?)","Hmmmm. I'm split over this. In one scene they made him very over the top (stuffing his face with a pastry and cream all over like he's a kid). In another he's well spoken and coherent.","Oh yes it was pretty good. Unfortunately its not on any streaming sites. I would love to rewatch it.","Creed was missing as far as I could tell. Stanley seems a hit or miss. Kevin was kinda okay. I only hope they develop the characters into bigger more rounded roles and not just focus on Chadda/Pammi/Amit/TP","TP (Desi Dwight) : I'm the Assistant Regional Manager\nChadda (Desi Scott) : \u003e!Regional Manager KA assistant!\u003c","Bhadoria is Creed","Yeah he's too hot headed.

Wow, these guys are worser than I thought.","Therein lies the problem with all American sitcoms. Everything has to be cheery and has to have a happy ending. But life isn't like that is it? On top of that almost all these American shows become full time romantic drama with a splash of comedy to justify its genre(Scrubs, HIMYM, BBT,Friends) which i just hate. Why won't they just make a few lesser episodes but fill it with comedy? The only American comedy that sticks to comedy is Veep which is one of the best comedies out there.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d335e77ba9c57f14063da43"},"flair":"Non-Political","selftext":"##No Long Posts From Now On\n\n##Thanks for the Platinum Reddit stranger\n\n**Intro** - *Please read the edits too.*\n\n**Prologue** - *The following post is written in no way to justify the actions of crass men who exist in our society and unfortunately it's quite shameful for even us that such men exist who harrass women and make their lives hell. Even I am not perfect and have my own flaws. I have written it at start and not at the end edit part so that people atleast read this and not call me misogynist, sexist pig who has written this for petty karma or gilding without reading. Or even call me someone who would brag about his masculinity and inflated ego.*\n\nNow coming to the main part as to how-if not most-many women treat mediocre/average guys when they approach the ladies after practising what to say and shitting their pants. This hit me yesterday when someone said why are you taking it personally, well if someone tells their side of the story maybe it's time for me to also tell the least discussed opposite side of the coin.\n\nBefore I start let me tell you a small life story of my first proposal that till today taught me a lot. A month or two before exams a few of neighborhood friends and me decided to take private group tuitions. This is where I met my crush. So after boards, JEE mains and advanced and BITSAT all had ended we used to hang out a bit often. One day while we came back from lunch because her birthday's party was due, I told her that I had developed something for her that I couldn't explain. She said she got to know by my actions and a very caring attitude and treatment. So I still remember we were D block parking, CP where she told me these lines that I try to quote nearly what I remember. \"I have no feelings for you and I have to say NO to you. It might hurt you today but you'll remember me for good.\" \nThat moment was the most heartbreaking moment for me, I won't lie I didn't say a word, left her alone there, took a metro and came back home. On the way back I deleted her number, deleted the message chat on my Nokia. I accepted her decision, though I cried but did accept. After about 10-12 days we meet, I have no feelings for her anymore like 85% were dead, 15% remained because she was my crush. She hugged me and said sorry for she was rude(which she wasn't) and I too said sorry for leaving her alone and coming back home and deleting her number and everything immature I did. \n\nSo to this day we are great friends and she has been an amazing advisor to me. How did that happen? It's because she didn't keep me on strings and told me one word i.e. **NO**. She didn't make pathetic excuses, kept me on hold or played with my emotions. What if she had played with me? I couldn't answer that but eventually found out as I grew up.\n\nJumping back to the present stage. A few weeks backs I announced at the LNRDT that I am going on my first date after a long time. I was really excited. I trimmed my hair, shaved my beard, chose perfect shirt and jeans and took out my new sneakers. Told mom I was going on my X friend's birthday in a cafe in CP. Though she might have guessed it's entirely a different story. I get a WhatsApp maybe hour or so before leaving that due to hot weather she can't make it as her parents aren't allowing. I thought it might be genuine concern and then said let's catch-up someday evening. I was pretty much sad but somehow consoled myself that it's just being shifted and not being cancelled. That's when things started to get shady. She gradually stopped reply to my texts and when I finally asked her about 10 days later why is she playing with me and ghosting me she told me \"She was sorry to play around me, but she had found someone else who was more compatible and *taller* than me.\" I said ok bye. I hung up, deleted her chats and number and remembered the my first rejection.\n\nHere comes the main part how we (addressing mediocre and average looking men) are treated by women who are significantly out of our aukat. \n\n* When you try to hit on them or even ask them out instead of telling **NO** they play along. They emotionally drain us and make us feel that even though we are shit as compared to them, still if we improve ourselves we can become capable of dating them. In the meanwhile they use our goodness and services and we act as their butlers, keeping track of their lives, sharing their happiness and being with them in their times of hardship. \n* Then when they feel we have improved ourselves and get ready to propose again with much confidence and improvements, they drop the emotional blackmail bomb. They simply address it by saying that \"What if we break up, what if we aren't compatible, what if we fight\", and so many guilt trip giving queries. Then drops the nuclear missile, \"See I don't want to lose a caring human being like you, in these few days we have become more like best friends but not a couple.\"\n* The guys pretty much get into the guilty feeling of losing such an amazing human being in life and settle for sticking around as a friend killing all the feelings after being put on strings and never told a straight forward NO.\n* Poor guys like us don't even get a clue that it was never going to happen. It was just a way of slowly controlling us like a puppet to have their way.\n* Even if the above scenario doesn't take place, it's alternative takes place. Where comes in the close friends WhatsApp groups that has screenshots of the guys pictures, all chats and girls mocking how that guy doesn't her standards and too average to be presentable. Instead of again telling a **NO** game is played, excuses are built up and a whole circle of the same activity takes place, where eventually the guy suffers as he is emotionally drained, stuck in between like a dhobi ka kutta (washerman's dog). Can't even get away from her because friendship and can't even come closer because standards don't match and he is kept for entertainment purposes.\n* Or if you are a bit above average like my friend and you get a proposal and you turn it down straightway saying you aren't interested, the girl says she is going to take her life and then your life again gets in hell. Or you fall into the trap of dating someone who just broke up and dates you to be her emotional punching bag.\n\nWhat's one thing common here? Selective biasness or as someone pointed out the Halo Effect. \n\n\u003e The halo effect is a cognitive bias that causes¬†one trait (e.g., beauty) to drastically color your perception of all other traits. If you think someone is beautiful, you are also likely to assume they‚Äôre smart, ambitious, interesting, etc.\n\nSimply saying it means that if a guy is good looking he is smart, trustworthy and compatible. But if a guy is average/mediocre he doesn't match your standards, would turn out to be creepy and even clingy.\n\nThat's why ladies readily accept a good looking guy, but keeps the average looking guy on hold/strings. Where she is the captain of his emotions. She will decide whether his feelings should stay or get killed. She won't ever say straightway **NO** but play and give excuses, stall, keep the person on strings. Till he is emotionally drained, mentally exhausted and aggression grips him. \n\nBut see our plight you know, even though both good looking and mediocre looking people belong to the gender shared by rapists, harrassers, assaulter etc, who gets instantly blacklisted quite a few times? The mediocre looking guy and good looking guy gets a free pass . And it's not just my story, it the story of countless people who are termed as lifeless virgins nowadays. \n\nI know women go through the major hardships but when they are asked why didn't they say **NO**, they say because they don't want to be at the receiving end of the outcome. Well no denying they have to deal with psychos, but also they get out of that situation easily by always making the same excuse. For that no one would blame them thanks to such crass people who share the same gender with us. Who ends up at the real receiving end? Ofcourse the average looking guys. Because we don't have anything of our own after we propose or luckily get into a relationship with a woman up a higher notch. She is the holder of our emotions, she can blackmail us easily because we aren't her level and she has done a massive favour for us. She controls us emotionally and mentally. And in that process we get torn into bits and pieces. **The excuses and keeping us on strings where straightway a harsh and hurting truth in form of NO, could have been told, we get more agressive and much more fanatic. Getting in a relationship becomes an obsession because we are drained of emotions and love and affection is all we need.**\n\nThinking of all my dates and talking to my friends yesterday one things is clear, how to get a bit of love and affection, we give up a huge part of our emotional self. Where instead of giving ourselves and our families and friends importance we get trapped and give someone the importance and limelight who is just there to play around and fiddle with us. For women they can easily say they don't trust men but what can we say? Nothing? We are just played along the way and blamed eventually for all things that we do and even might not have done ever.\n\n**And weird part is nearly everyone I talked to from a few friends to Reddit strangers** have gone through same shit, but it never comes to light because we are the tough gender. Handling rejections shouldn't be a huge task for us. How to tell handling rejections would have been easier if it was a simple NO and not a game of snakes and ladders. It's somewhere our fault too that we fail to take note of all that glitters is not gold kind of situation. That we fail to move on rather than going down the spiral. Is a straight NO too much to ask for? Are we such low class begins that telling us **NO** on face has such negative impact?\n\nI don't know how people will respond to me, maybe I get downvoted, maybe I get abused, maybe I get called out for shifting the blame or anything. But one thing for sure is I feel somewhat sad and happy at the same time while writing this down. Sad because I couldn't take control of the situations even though my intuition said so and happy because I could tell the least discussed side of my lives.\n\n**What's the way out? Simple, rather than being someone's dog on leash, live your life alone with friends and family and do arranged marriage at the end. Because you don't have those attractive genes and inner beauty matters shit when you only seen to be a friendship material.**\n\nPS - While saving this it made me realise how quite a lot of us get ill treated and never have the courage to speak out but at the same time I realised, **HOW WE ILL TREAT WOMEN AT TIMES TOO IN THE NAME OF FORCED LOVE AND AFFECTION. AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IF I HAVE EVEN FOR A MOMENT ILL TREATED SOMEONE.**\n\n##Thanks to my crush for making me stronger and more emotionally sound as a human being to handle rejections better and part ways with someone who isn't available to share her feelings\n\nEdit 1: Don't abuse anyone, I have written this post from all your experiences, so be a bit more sensible and even if girls comment something let them comment and read their views as well. We have to be a bit courteous fellas.\n\n**Edit 2: People saying you get played because of kindness and all. I have seen enough shit so I don't fall for it now because of my experience and people around me who advice me. But for people who are alone and no one to guide/advice them are blinded by emotions and you can't blame them at all. They aren't experienced much and this post might give them a harsh reality that they still might not accept.**\n\nEdit 3: Please stop DMing me that everything will be alright. I am fine c'mon. I read between the lines now since my last date, so don't fall for that trap anymore probably. Help the helpless ones in comments. They need some guidance.\n\nEdit 4: Thanks for that Silver ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n**Edit 5: This post is to tell you to move on. That if you feel stuck, time to get off and life your life with dedication towards yourself. IT'S AN EYE OPENER FOR YOU ALL. It's not at all about I am a nice guy, I should get women like fuckboys and handsome guys do. It's about learning about your flaws as well.**\n\nEdit 6: Thanks for the Gold ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nEdit 7: I won't keep replying I am tired and have to do work as well. Atleast read the edits before you raise the same point.\n\n**Edit 8: For women my message is simple, I know boys are shit and you don't always need to give them a NO because of your safety but atleast have enough courtesy to not play with their emotions. Don't keep him as a friend if you know he still has feelings for you and can rebound back. Let him go, don't make him feel guilty about himself.

The more fuckboi type the better, it'll show you the flip side from the girls' POV. Right now you seem to be having the feeling that girls have it perfect in the dating game but that's actually not true, they have similar issues and if you can see how badly they're affected by rejection or how much they pursue the people they like then you'll be a lot more empathetic and take the whole dating scenario less to heart. \n\nI have a friend who's so good looking that when we were in second year of college, the graduating batch of that year (4th year) used to lust after him. This is pretty uncommon cause almost no college relationship used to be between a senior girl and a junior boy. His life stories, the FB messages he received, the constant attention he got from random girls in events like fests was actually very instructive to me. It helped humanizing girls for me, like I could see that they're as desperate and stupid in the dating scenario as guys are and that really helped me in realising that it's not as if wo rajah hai aur hum kangal.

Men are expendable, their feelings are expendable, their desires are expendable. There is reason arrange marriage exists in India, which is because the dating culture is shite. You need to understand this is a world of give and take. If don't have anything meaningful to offer, you have zero worth. And I am not talking about personality. That comes last. They look for things like can you provide for them? Can you give them a social status? Does their social status improve upon dating/marrying you? There is nothing wrong with this. This how humans have been surviving through all these years. Not because of \"love\". But because of greed. Greed have something better in life. Greed to have something better for your offsprings. It's our most basic survival emotion. Check out this standup on [being dark and getting married.](https://youtu.be/aTUiGWJinX0)\n\nBut what do I know? Neither I am from IIT or IIM? Just normal guy trying to bring balance to this universe.","Lol, this feels kinda weird reading this post and all the other relationship stuff here, when you can't even imagine yourself being in a relationship. too distant, its almost unreal.","Assume its a No unless you get a solid Yes. Is that so difficult?\n\nIt may seem difficult, but given the unequal power equations in Indian society, that is the only way to resolve this for now. Assume a No.\n\nI am saying this from experience as an unkil. Worked for me. I was obsessed with some girl or the other since LKG. But I also had a massive ego (different from self confidence, which I did not have much of). But I was absolutely clear that I will not make a fool of myself by chasing someone who does not truly care. Worked all my life. Not just in love, but in every personal relationship. \n\nWhy is it so difficult? \n\nI can understand why. A NO means that you do not match up to the requirements of the girl. That is REALITY. Accept that you will not match up to the wishes of a vast majority of people - forget girls - ALL YOUR LIFE. Cut your losses and move on. Do no spend time dreaming. There is always someone on your wavelength around.\n\nWhat if that someone is not visible anywhere? Two things.\n\n1. You are in the wrong environment. Run. If you are in the wrong place, you are probably not going to find someone who likes you.\n\n2. Learn to build your personality and advertise it. Sell it. Evaluate yourself using the harshest possible standards you can find, find your biggest flaws, and work on them. Find your biggest strengths, and make sure that those strengths - whether it be focus, professionalism, caring, affection - are visible to all potential candidates. Visible, but not in their faces. And not by going and telling them about it. When you do this, the right kind of people WILL COME TO YOU. This works for both men and women, in my experience.\n\nWhat about the occasional confused ones, and the liars and cheaters?\n\nThey do exist. They are products of their family, environment. When you get a hint that someone is like that, again, resort to a highly critical evaluation of that person. If they fail, run. There is no need, there is always someone who fits better.\n\nDo not oversell yourself. Your overselling is obvious, in most cases. People can see through your disguises, especially when you are young and faking it. Even if you manage to fool yourself, people can see through you somewhat. Be honest to yourself and the rest of the world (to the extent that its safe to). It will give you solid skills in understanding who is honest to you, and dishonest or self deceiving with you.\n\nBack to my first point. Assume a NO. You don't want to, I know. But the answer is NO in most cases. Live with it. Evolution decided that for you.","I want to make a separate post [told it here before many times] about how my so called ex gf ruined 3 whole years of my life and i didnt even know why until the end of the said 3 years. \n\nIf anyone wants to hear it, i will gladly show to the pseudo feminists why women arent so pure as they think they are.\n\nEDIT: Posted","Call me a whiteknight or a pseudo feminist or whatever you want. But if your post is in a way a disagreement of the previous post then it's probably an overreaction. \n\nThat post was about girls not saying No because of personal safety and there were multiple stories to back it up. Now you say a girl should say NO specifically because you  and some men feel like you got friendzoned or strung along and played with your emotions. \n\nWhether you are a creep or not doesn't come printed on your forehead. And if it could then those creeps would have done it too. Getting played along or friendzoned or emotionally hurt is a choice,you can opt out of it with a little introspection, however difficult it might be \n\nThat was the entire point of the previous post,if it's not an enthusiastic yes,it's a no. Follow it to the T and you won't get played or hurt. \n\nRegarding your personal accounts,I agree somewhat because I am also an average looking guy. But I'm not gonna obsess over getting a girl that is a notch higher than me. If you are stuck in the same primitive vanity fest mindsets of judging your self-worth with the conventional attractiveness of your partner then you don't get the right to complain when they themselves turn out to be vanity fests and judge people based on things like height. Fuck(forget) that tinder girl and hope you'll find someone better,even if she's not as pretty or whatever.\n\nI also want to say I wish men's issues were discussed more but this is not a \"vs\",in this case that post was easily the more correct one. From my experience too my cousin was stalked,and a friend of mine asked someone out and she didn't seem enthusiastic about it so my friend took it well and cancelled their date and they never talked again and he moved on pretty well. None of that played along or friendzoned drama.","Bro, before I break it to you, let me tell you that I have a non-existent dating life and it's not survivorship bias talking here. \n\nSo the thing is that we humans which includes women as well, are animals in our nature and have the same basic instincts. Just like a female animal in the wild will choose the best and fittest mate, similarly a human female will always be inclined to choose the best of the lot available to her, and by best I mean best in what matters to her. \n\nI don't think that absolutely any woman in this world owes anything to us, or that we deserve anything (\"we\" includes every man, handsome or not). She is a human, so are we, she can choose to spend her time with whoever she wants and so can we.  \n\nThe point that they go for looks and not for \"inner beauty\" is moot. Let her go for looks if she wants to, and thinking that you have a lot of \"inner beauty\" and the handsome guy doesn't is stupid until you are sure beyond any doubt. \n\nAnd about keeping us on strings, now is the time to learn to be assertive and start thinking with your head rather than your dick. You get treated the way you allow yourself to be treated.","OP, you say you are an average or below average guy.

This write-up has a ton of good points man but there's one thing I don't fully agree on with you. Just because we're average looking guys doesn't mean we're lower than them. That's just toxic mentality man, to yourself. First you gotta love yourself , try for whoever you want but love yourself first and place yourself first (this is much harder to do than it seems, I speak from experience). There's no one above your league, if you put yourself first you can see when you're turning into a lap dog for her and you can snap out of it and tell objectively whether she's actually worth it.\nI know that bullshit feeling you get where you bias yourself because of your feelings and how you put them at a higher value than yourself but that is the problem in this whole situation.\n\nI think putting yourself comes from understanding that we don't NEED a relationship to be happy and that our friends and whatever we have makes us who we are and makes happy not some ideal future we expect out of a relationship.","lol wtf? how old are you? no offense but you sound immature af. if a woman wants to date you, she will make it abundantly clear. why would you waste your time with someone who doesn't want to date you and 'hover' around them? yes women are afraid of saying no but for them to get harassed by guys is a very common occurrence. it's not a one off thing. so if they are not being direct about saying no, you should learn to read between the lines. be straightforward with them. if a woman doesn't seem to be enthusiastic and isn't reciprocating about being with you, chin the fuck up and stop hovering around them dude. \n\ni hate saying this but this is some top tier r/niceguys shit dude. a woman's friendship is not some consolation trophy.\n\n\u003eEven if the above scenario doesn't take place, it's alternative takes place.

Some will love you unconditionally and some will try to break you just for their thrill, what matters is how confident are you with yourself and how much faith you have on your actions and also how well you learn from your mistakes.\n\nIn my experience, keeping your intentions clear from the begining is the best course of action. Don't keep beating around the bush in the hope that someday that person will miraculously get to know about your feelings, even if they do they won't act on it because you were too afraid to present them confidently and properly. For cases where you did everything right and still the outcome was not what you expected, don't bend according to their needs, just back off, remember what you were there for. \nAlso, don't intermix relations. This is especially true for the one's who try finding romantic partners in their friends. It's a very rare occurence and it can never be made to happen. If it is gonna happen, eventually it will otherwise it's a big No No. \n\nBe confident, have faith in yourself, good things will happen to you in life.","It's not only looks that gives you girls,  I have average/ugly looking face. I'm tall and have good physique, I eat healthy and exercise regularly. Take good care of what I have. Most importantly I have great interpersonal communication skills and good behaviour. And good behaviour is not reserved only for girls it's for everyone, my friends, parents, siblings. I had an awesome relationship with a girl in college which didn't end up in a marriage because of social differences and right now I'm again in a sweet relationship with a beautiful girl which is going good.\n\nWhat works for me is conversation skills, being confident, honesty and being able to walk away when not getting responses. Don't take rejections personally and be someone who is fun to be with. Why would a girl want to be with a bitter, sad and needy man? Be honest about your intentions from the beginning. And be firm about it without being rude/bitter. ( Like you are awesome girl and I like being with you but not just as a friend) Learn when to say no don't be pleaser. Don't do big favours or spent too much if you are not comfortable and looking for a return immediately. Having money helps but don't  try to be a sugar daddy if you want a sweet and intimate relationship.\n\nLive your life and follow your goals. If someone doesn't like you it's completely ok because there are people that you also don't like , When you can like everyone, then you can expect the same...

Your post hits home too hard.\n\nTLDR : An average looking short guy rants about hypocrisy of women.\n\nFirstly, the saying No part, the girls of this country are either too scared (rightly so) or they just give chances to douchebags who can't take no for an answer.\n\nSecondly, the looks part. Oh, lord, don't get me started. There's a myth that if you are good guy girls will like you, looks don't matter at all. But man, the reality is completely opposite. You can be dipshit who treats weaker guys as shit and still  have girls around you. Seen it school, college and workplace. Can't be coincidence, right?\n\nMoreover, I am a short guy, about 5'4 and boyish face but yeah I like to believe I'm a good guy. Not a part of nice guys but a guy with interests and hobbies. \n\nI have never in my life, have got a girl to even consider me something other than a \"friend\". Once I asked one of my friend, that if she thinks something more can happen between us, just asked her, hypothetical if there's anything possible; not even a second later, bam! Comes her answer : No, but if you were a bit taller, it would have. Now I had no intentions to date her, I was just asking. But this answer of hers was so shallow, it made me think of her hypocrisy.\n\nAnd she says looks don't matter, have a good nature etc and all that bullshit. But at the first instance what matters to her is height. Wow.\n\nI have asked this as scenario to various girls as an experiment in my school \u0026 college years, average looking and beautiful girls too, they all had more or less the same answers. \"You're a good guy, but I prefer someone taller.\" When there own height is 5 something. \n\nI mean what the hell.\n\nAs much sympathize with their everyday struggles and condition in our country, but for this point, I would say screw women for being hypocritical pricks.","Lekin phir recharge kaun karayega, ghoomne kaun le jayega.

This leads to lots of young women(college age) deciding to stay single rather than become GF of a median guy. \n\nEven after being below avg. looking guy I have rejected avg. looking girls because I didn't feel motivated to be their full time BF and associated drama that comes with it. But if a hot girl had asked I would have done it. I don't see this kind of fucked up dating situation in South America though.\n\n\u003eAssume its a No unless you get a solid Yes. Is that so difficult?\n\nWhat these young men are not realizing is that they are being kept as a backup. Good strategy is to be a casual \"orbiter\" of many girls who can't give you a definite yes. But once the girl goes through a breakup, just go in full force and get into a relationship/fuck_buddy arrangement with her.","Why are you assuming that all women are the same?

When you play chess you have the right to whatever move you want to make (within the rules of the game for sure) but you have ***no absolute control***  on how the opponent will go about their move. Still you **desire** to win the game and you should. Krishna never said to Arjuna, \"You should not desire to kill\" or \"You should not desire to win the battle\". Krishna does say in the next part - \" **‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§´‡§≤‡§π‡•á‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§§‡•á ‡§∏‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø** \" - the outcome should not be the ultimate force for your action, and you should not shy away from your duties. Again, isn't it common sense that you must focus on the action and the thought of outcome should not affect your actions. Going in the battle, and attacking the opponent has a desire - to kill. Though, it is not entirely in your hand whether the opponent will die or not. But you still desire them to die. There is a difference in desiring for some outcome and focusing on the outcome. Do desire the outcome but focus on the action.\n\nEdit: (word change)","Bhai hard work kar ke kuch nahi hota life mein work smart.","Dignity?

It's not just about girls, guards in fancy clubs don't sneer at me, random relatives have started praising my looks, strangers are so much nicer to me when I meet them and in general it's like the difference in the way a guy with really expensive clothes is treated compared to a guy who is roaming around in his pyjamas. So as someone who was treated \"normally\" when I was tanned I now guiltily enjoy the special treatment now though I doubt I'd even realise it if I hadn't been tanned earlier.\n\n\nPS this might be an unfair (pun intended) generalisation but I've seen that fair skinned girls don't care about skin colour of the guy as much as dark skinned girls do. Also South Indian girls are way more into the fair skinned BF thing than North Indian girls are. I think it's cause you desire what you don't have and dark skinned girls since childhood have been scrutinized minutely for the merest hint of a change in skin tone and they have internalised it so much that they naturally have a fetish for fair skin. North Indian Girls who were naturally fair skinned on the other hand actually reject guys who are fairer than them for some reason.

This is only a half-truth. For Islam divides as inexorably as it binds. Islam is a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction. The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is a fraternity, but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation. For those who are outside the corporation, there is nothing but contempt and enmity. The second defect of Islam is that it is a system of social self-government and is incompatible with local self-government, because the allegiance of a Muslim does not rest on his domicile in the country which is his but on the faith to which he belongs. To the Muslim ibi bene ibi patria [Where it is well with me, there is my country] is unthinkable. Wherever there is the rule of Islam, there is his own country. In other words, Islam can never allow a true Muslim to adopt India as his motherland and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin.\"\n\n\u003e\"The social evils which characterize the Hindu Society, have been well known. The publication of 'Mother India' by Miss Mayo gave these evils the widest publicity. But while 'Mother India' served the purpose of exposing the evils and calling their authors at the bar of the world to answer for their sins, it created the unfortunate impression throughout the world that while the Hindus were grovelling in the mud of these social evils and were conservative, the Muslims in India were free from them, and as compared to the Hindus, were a progressive people. That, such an impression should prevail, is surprising to those who know the Muslim Society in India at close quarters.\"\n\n\u003e\n\"Take the caste system. Islam speaks of brotherhood. Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. Regarding slavery nothing needs to be said. It stands abolished now by law. But while it existed much of its support was derived from Islam and Islamic countries. But if slavery has gone, caste among Musalmans has remained. There can thus be no manner of doubt that the Muslim Society in India is afflicted by the same social evils as afflict the Hindu Society. Indeed, the Muslims have all the social evils of the Hindus and something more. That something more is the compulsory system of purdah for Muslim women.\"\n\n\u003e \"Mr. Gandhi has been very punctilious in the matter of condemning any and every act of violence and has forced the Congress, much against its will to condemn it. But Mr Gandhi has never protested against such murders [of Hindus]. Not only have the Musalmans not condemned these outrages, but even Mr Gandhi has never called upon the leading Muslims to condemn them. He has kept silent over them. Such an attitude can be explained only on the ground that Mr Gandhi was anxious to preserve Hindu-Moslem unity and did not mind the murders of a few Hindus, if it could be achieved by sacrificing their lives...This attitude to excuse the Muslims any wrong, lest it should injure the cause of unity, is well illustrated by what Mr Gandhi had to say in the matter of the Mopla riots. The blood-curdling atrocities committed by the Moplas in Malabar against the Hindus were indescribable. All over Southern India, a wave of horrified feeling had spread among the Hindus of every shade of opinion, which was intensified when certain Khilafat leaders were so misguided as to pass resolutions of \"congratulations to the Moplas on the brave fight they were conducting for the sake of religion\". Any person could have said that this was too heavy a price for Hindu-Moslem unity. But Mr Gandhi was so much obsessed by the necessity of establishing Hindu-Moslem unity that he was prepared to make light of the doings of the Moplas and the Khilafats who were congratulating them. He spoke of the Moplas as the \"brave God-fearing Moplas who were fighting for what they consider as religion and in a manner which they consider as religious \".\n\n\u003e\"The only allegiance a Musalman, whether civilian or soldier, whether living under a Muslim or under a non-Muslim administration, is commanded by the Koran to acknowledge is his allegiance to God, to his Prophet and to those in authority from among the Musalmans‚Ä¶\" Ambedkar adds: \"This must make anyone wishing for a stable government very apprehensive. But this is nothing to the Muslim tenets which prescribe when a country is a motherland to the Muslim and when it is not‚Ä¶According to Muslim Canon Law the world is divided into two camps, Dar-ul-lslam (abode of Islam), and Dar-ul-Harb (abode of war). A country is Dar-ul-lslam when it is ruled by Muslims. A country is Dar-ul-Harb when Muslims only reside in it but are not rulers of it. That being the Canon Law of the Muslims, India cannot be the common motherland of the Hindus and the Musalmans. It can be the land of the Musalmans‚Äîbut it cannot be the land of the 'Hindus and the Musalmans living as equals.' Further, it can be the land of the Musalmans only when it is governed by the Muslims. The moment the land becomes subject to the authority of a non-Muslim power, it ceases to be the land of the Muslims. Instead of being Dar-ul-lslam it becomes Dar-ul-Harb.\n\n\"It must not be supposed that this view is only of academic interest. For it is capable of becoming an active force capable of influencing the conduct of the Muslims‚Ä¶It might also be mentioned that Hijrat [emigration] is not the only way of escape to Muslims who find themselves in a Dar-ul-Harb. There is another injunction of Muslim Canon Law called Jihad (crusade) by which it becomes \"incumbent on a Muslim ruler to extend the rule of Islam until the whole world shall have been brought under its sway. The world, being divided into two camps, Dar-ul-lslam (abode of Islam), Dar-ul-Harb (abode of war), all countries come under one category or the other. Technically, it is the duty of the Muslim ruler, who is capable of doing so, to transform Dar-ul-Harb into Dar-ul-lslam.\" And just as there are instances of the Muslims in India resorting to Hijrat, there are instances showing that they have not hesitated to proclaim Jihad.‚Äù","\u003e Are you saying caste system developed among Muslims after 1947?\n\n\nI never said that.

Maybe, I would loosen myself up a bit and not take my college life too seriously.\n\nI mean, in the intentions of not bragging, I was the kind of student who didn't bunk classes and was quite \"studious and regular/proper\" (or so I was considered by others aka I was a dorky loser). I only started to bunk classes at the very last semester and that was because by then, the faculty themselves stopped attending classes or even give a darn.\n\nAnd yet, that regularity and \"proper\" behavior brought me nowhere, as I barely got to learn anything academically, in my college years (due to the poor quality of infra and faculty but more importantly due to me realizing that engineering wasn't for me but still I tried my best hence why I tried to be regular as possible in the first place).\n\nI guess, I was also paranoid and superstitious believing that the day I bunk classes, that's when me (and all others) would get busted and get a hefty punishment or something like that.\n\nI would definitely join clubs or guilds to discover, refine and unlock my potentials. Though sadly, my college never had those facilities to begin with (aside from sports which I really don't have an interest in and which was below average/mediocre anyway).\n\nI would definitely try to find a person who might end up being my SO. This is perhaps my biggest regret, as I was too shy, insecure and embarrassed to approach and talk with the opposite gender and even maintain a platonic, non- romantic friendship with them.\n\nI feel that I may not get this chance again or rather it won't be easy as it will be in college. And thus, I'll have to trust my parents with the alliances they bring me (aka arranged marriage) but tbh, I really don't trust or believe in them, as they will phone-it-in (they have been emotionally neglectful but I guess they try their best) and would chew me out and emotionally blackmail/abuse me if I don't accept their offers.\n\nSo, definitely I'll find my future SO on my own and feel that it's not too late, but again it's a bit harder than finding one through college life imo.\n\nBut I guess in the end, the outcome that has actually happened (aka reality) is the best of outcomes, imo.\n\nTL;DR - 1.would try to be less \"uptight, formal and stuffy\" and loosen up a bit.\n2.Would join in clubs and guilds to discover, refine and unlock my hidden potential and talents. \n3.Would try to find my future SO if I'm able to, as the saying is that finding one's SO is the easiest when one is in their student phase.\n\nBut, the outcome that happened (aka reality) is the best of outcomes, imo so I guess I'll have to learn to be satisfied with what has happened in my life so far.","Fair enough, I suppose.\n\nThen again, Carl Fredrickson from Up, decided to venture onto a journey at such a ripe age (and decided to venture onto a new one, after reading the posthumous advice his late wife had to give).\n\nSure, he is a person of fiction (and his adventure was pretty surreal, indeed) but I guess there are people out there in our real world I guess, who kinda had the chance to \"live their lives \" only at such a ripe phase in their lives, I suppose.\n\nOfcourse, that's assuming one gets to live past 50 and 60 years of age, I suppose.

Very few match my interests and I'm plainly not interested to get into a relationship just for the sake of one. But yeah, I do make sure that I develop my social skills - especially with the opposite gender. \n\nYou have a ton of time dude. Early 20's is really young for a guy to worry about marriage.

We graduated from college, went our separate ways, but still kept in touch, except conversations started becoming heavily one sided. While I'm flattered that he finds me a safe space to talk about his fears and embarrassments, I'm more than a dumping ground, and he hadn't been acknowledging that for a couple of years. I suggested therapy, because his fears are negatively impacting the way he functions, he refused. I suggested talking to the girl he likes and is chewing my ears out talking about her for months, he said no. I finally put up boundaries, telling him it's getting too much for me at this point (at several moments, until I became explicit about it), he ghosted me altogether and stopped replying to texts I sent the days after. It's been a month. Time to let go for good now. It hurts, but it seems like a lost cause.

Gave me the heeby-jeebies. \n\nCue I'm 22-23. Felt alone after a break up. Had a soft spot for derpy little faces on r/aww and on reddit in general. Their faces and those gifs just made things nicer for me I guess? Always wanted to build up the courage to pet one and eventually keep one as a pet. Lots of reading up about dogs ensued for like 5 months I think? \n\nThen dated a girl who was big on dogs. Travelled to her place once. Her landlord had left his pet Labrador, Rambo, with the watchman in the apartment and my ex used to take Rambo out for walks. She took me along one day. She tied this huge Labrador weighing like 50kgs to a railing and went in to the store to buy stuff. She came back and gave me a packet of parle g to feed Rambo and promptly went back in to finish her shopping. I wouldn't go near Rambo but he was real gentle and made me go soft and gooey on the inside. I took the biscuits out to feed him and he ate them from my hand without even touching my hand. Never experienced that before - feeding a dog. And when I did it was nothing like I figured it would be. I wasn't scared. I was genuinely happy. Gave me the courage to pet him. I pet two other dogs on the same walk back home and I held Rambos leash. \n\nCouple months later girlfriend got me a rescue puppy. That pupper is close to four years now and she is a bundle of joy. Naughty af cause I can't train for shit but she knows what's up with me always. Friendliest little bitch you'll ever meet. \n\nTl;dr: was scared of dogs for 23 years of my life. Fell for their derpy faces during a difficult time. Then fed a gentle giant for the first time. Never looked back. Have a four year old bundle of joy now.","u/ppatra owns a dog","Ive really come to love and sympathise with dogs now","If it's really something you aim to do I would say please visit a good psychiatrists.

Stop buying crap from Amazon!","[deleted]","You need to go for multiple interviews, and bag many offers. Let each person know what the other side is offering, and demand a higher value, but politely.\n\nSomething like _I would love to work with you guys, because of xyz; but I also cannot say no to company B, and how much they're offering. It'd close the deal between us with no second guessing from my side, if I could get about 20% on top of what they've been offering_.\n\nThey might say _no we have to maintain parity_ or _we don't have that much in our budget_ etc., but you can say, _well, that's a shame. I'd definitely consider your offer, and I appreciate being open with me._\n\nBe polite, but firm, in your position. Make every company know what you value about them, why you'd consider them over others; but you also wouldn't want to leave money on the table.\n\nSome companies even do this - they'd go so far as to say _we cannot give you that right now, but we'll be able to in 6 months / 1 year_ etc.\n\nYou can always come back with _But CPI data indicates that for urban metro living populace, inflation is almost at 8% p.a., and considering time-value of money, I cannot just throw away a chance to be able to earn the extra amount today._\n\nPersonal experience, this worked for me.\n\nIn any case, don't be rude, and get your points across. Having competing offer helps. And going to more interviews means you'll also get to practice doing real interviews.\n\nOne piece of advice: don't go for a company just because that's paying you the most. You might not be happy there, unless the difference is a lot.","Which fund?","I truly am sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, this is what I've heard too; when I was looking for insurance for a person in my family, who had some history of mental issues.\n\nHowever, things could be changing. Some insurers have started accepting clients with history of mental issues.\n\nDon't go by Coverfox. Personally reach out to some TPAs in your city, especially if they support PSU insurers.\n\nAnother option would be to accept this and build a significant medical corpus, to be able to handle medical bills when he gets hospitalized.","If you want to learn, just continue and don't care about profit just yet.

But I'd not go into that, as you probably just want to learn hands-on.\n\nThen it leaves the DP charges. You either trade less or trade with more money. DP charges are fixed most probably, and not related to the amount you invest.","First thing you need to focus on, is discipline of saving. If I were in your shoes with 30-50k every month to invest; I'd first make sure I _can_ indeed do so every month.\n\nPeople overestimate their savings, under-estimate their expenses.\n\nI'd recommend start with tracking expenses, and imposing some restrictions on yourself (like, no more than twice eating out in a month, or no more than x INR per month on Amazon purchases).\n\nYou can start like this:\n\n- Assume you can save 50k per month.\n\n   When you get salary at the beginning of the month, send that amount to a second bank account you own; then try not to have to touch that amount throughout the month.\n\n- Practice this for 3 months - controlling your expenses in a way, that you can save 50k (or whatever amount you come up with) every month, reliably.\n\n  This is also a great time for you to get started with learning about taxes, investments, financial planning etc.\n\n- Let that extra money grow in your second bank account for 5-6 months.\n\n  It could become a corpus that can be used for emergencies. If you have this in place, your investment plans won't easily get derailed.\n\n  Depending on your requirements, your actual emergency corpus can be higher than this. But it's a good start.\n\n- 5-6 months later, you'd have some idea about how to invest and what to invest for; and an emergency corpus to fall back on.\n\n  Now, you can start with your investment plans\n\nThere's no hurry in investing. Market's there, opportunities are there, and they won't change drastically in next 5-6 months.\n\nBut if you can control your expenses and predict your savings; that gives you an edge most investors in the market don't have.\n\n In the long run, discipline and sticking to your plan, helps more than anything else.","ask in r/IndiaInvestments biweekly questions thread and read through the wiki there","I've a 1L FD with Yes Bank since 2016.

It's comparatively easier to point out actions that are definitely bad for your credit score.\n\nYou should definitely pay all bills that are due, on time.\n\nAvoid using No-EMI options, because an enquiry against your credit score would impact your score negatively. Similarly, don't apply for new credit cards frequently.\n\nI feel people are too obsessed with their credit score. It's just one of many metrics that would be used, in case you ever take a loan.\n\nYou can have the best score in the world, but you'd never get a loan if the loan officer in the bank thinks your income isn't high enough for you to be able to reliably pay the EMI every month.\n\nOn the other hand, you can have an ok credit score, and still get a loan or credit card approved if you have good enough income and assets.","In addition to what crimelabs786 said, the things that are in your control:\n\n1. Get credit cards ASAP (when you get your first job, say). You should be easily approved by the bank that you have a salary account with. Use it moderately and pay off in time. If you're self-employed or something, get a deposit-backed card to build your score.\n\n2. Try to get 2-3 cards. Don't go through (open and close) too many cards too fast.\n\n3. Avail every opportunity to get higher credit limits. After 6 months or so, banks offer you revised limits.","\u003eWill I need to start over building credit there?\n\nYes\n\nApartment rental has nothing to do with credit scores here. Usually landlords will ask for a deposit (1-2 lakhs for your rent range) and some form of ID in order to get a background check done by the police.","Credit score are not transferable between countries. You start from scratch here","Credit does not play as central a role in India as it does in the US. It's pretty much only needed for loans and credit cards (at least for now).\n\nIt sounds like you'll be well off, you should find it easy to obtain cards, don't need a score for the rest, but no it's not transferrable either way.\n\n(Although some companies like Amex do what's called a Global Transfer. They can approve you in the newer country based on your relationship in your previous country, if you do not have sufficient history in the newer country)","I uninstalled that app.\n\nNow I am a millionaire","Whatever you do invest in, if it's a mutual fund, avoid Regular plans. /u/Speedz007 recommended Wealthy.in, which is a Regular plan distributor.\n\nInvest in MFs (assuming you invest in MFs, and not in bank product), that have \"Direct\" in their names. You can do it from the fund house websites, or use any of the free direct plan platforms available - PayTM Money, Kuvera, Groww, ClearFunds, Piggy etc.\n\nIn Regular plans, a part of your corpus goes to the distributor as commission, and drags down your returns. Also note, recommendations from any Regular plan distributors should be treated with a pinch of salt, because they have a financial incentive to recommend a fund that's going to pay them a higher commission.\n\nNow, coming to your original question, you haven't provided much info; such as what other assets you have, how long don't you need that 30k, your upcoming financial targets etc.\n\nWithout such information, it's not possible to give anything other than simple generic advice; so I'll tell you what I'd do if I had spare 30k with no immediate plan to use that - I'd put it in a Liquid Fund or a bank FD.\n\nFDs can be a bit restrictive, but if you don't know what is a Liquid Fund or how to pick a decent one; just stick to FDs. Make sure you can open FD in a bank that can be redeemed online, and has low to zero premature withdrawal penalty.","If you have a regular monthly surplus, start with a SIP on something like wealthy.in. it won't give you the absolute best returns, but it's a good start.","**This comment is just to thank you.**\n\nI stumble upon your comments often on IndiaInvestments and each of them is a new learning for me.

Thanks!","5-6 lakhs of deposit if bangalore","But doesn't CIBIl come under TransUnion though?","[deleted]","This is why I put a disclaimer by saying 'it won't give you the absolute best returns'.\n\nYou give solid advice, but mostly the biggest hurdle a first time investor faces is the process. It gets so overwhelming to research and go through the process of how to invest your first 10k. Things like wealthy.in helps with that - and personally a ~0.5% fee is worth it. Overtime you figure out better and more efficient ways.\n\nThat said, FDs are probably the simplest. But I'd argue on most days you'd get better returns even with a regular MF plan with the same level of simplicity.","Seriously, we should just create our own wikipedia of u/crimelabs786 posts","My family member already had a policy with a PSU insurer. I was looking for porting out to a private insurer.\n\nIn hindsight, it was a bad idea. Same PSU insurer insures him to date. We renew it every year.\n\nHowever, we've never had to disclose his mental condition to the PSU insurer. Because while he was sick from a psychological disease, he was never hospitalized, so no claims were made.","Better interest rates and easier approval if and when you want to go for a house loan (or a business loan), as of now, and access to top credit cards.\n\nBut if the US model is anything to go by, they use credit scores for every single thing - renting property, giving you a phone on EMI, medical bills... you could totally imagine our credit scores being extended for all of these in the coming decades. But for now, just loans.","They don't ask for proof of income but they do ask for a letter from your employer that states that you're employed with them (it doesn't mention your salary). If you're unable to provide that, its possible to work things out between the landlord and yourself - maybe by paying some extra amount as deposit (definitely not a year though - more like a couple extra months).\n\nBargaining and negotiating are very useful skills in India :)","Areee... Gand hi phaad di tumne to bhai. :-(","doesnt matter, that is not how credit scores work","An FD would be fine. Make a 5 year FD if you want to.\n\nYou don't need to worry about Liquid Funds etc. right now. As a student, best investment for you is investing in your education / learning etc.\n\nIf you were planning to take some online course or certifications, you could use this.","\u003e Things like wealthy.in helps with that - and personally a ~0.5% fee is worth it.\n\nThis is a common set of arguments thrown around by distributors, but it only works on people who aren't interested in doing the numbers.\n\nNow I'm not sure if you already know this or have seen me writing these somewhere else, but I'll repeat it, just in case.\n\nThat small 0.5% fee isn't small. Nor is it 0.5%.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume someone invests 1L in an ELSS fund. It's not uncommon for ELSS funds to have lumpsum investment of 1L all at once, in fact a lot of people do it who want to get some last minute tax savings done.\n\nI've chosen a popular ELSS fund which one would normally pick after looking at past returns - Axis Long Term Equity.\n\nIn last 5 years, [the direct plan of this fund has given a CAGR of 15.86% p.a.](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/newsnapshot.asp?schemecode=15688). In 5 years, that'd make 1L turn into `(1 + 0.1586)^5 = 2.08L`.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone had invested that 1L mistakenly in Regular plan, the [same fund's regular plan has  given 14.56% p.a. return](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/newsnapshot.asp?schemecode=10826). In 5 years, that'd convert 1L into `(1 + 0.1456)^5 = 1.97L`.\n\nThat's a difference of about 11k.\n\nThat 0.5%-1% have eroded more than 10% of investors' initial corpus in Regular plan, in just 5 years! That money could've stayed with investor, but went to the distributor's pocket.\n\nDistributor adds no value to your investment. There are many online portals that you can use to do the same transaction. They cannot give you better funds, because they're no better than average. And most portals these days do have their own recommended set of funds, even the Direct ones.\n\nThis information should be freely available, because ultimately the fund manager is your advisor - and he's not going to make / update his stock picking decisions, just because your distributor sold you a plan.\n\nOf course, you can say I cherry-picked a fund, that has given higher returns. So let's pick a fund that hasn't given higher returns, but have given high commission (higher difference in expense ratios between regular and direct plan).\n\nI repeated same calculation for [Tata Large Cap fund](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/newsnapshot.asp?schemecode=509), which has given returns of 10%-11% over last 5 years. This is modest, and average.\n\nInvestment of 1L in its Direct plan would be 1.73L today, while investment of same amount in its regular plan would be about 1.62L today.\n\nThat difference of ~11k is still intact!\n\nYou can see that even if investors made less money, the distributor didn't.\n\nI'll summarize some points on distributors, and why they should be avoided:\n\n- They're paid for something, that can be obtained at fixed cost or even for free.\n- They have financial incentive to have the investor keep on investing, because their fees are proportional to corpus, not linked to performance.\n- There's nothing to suggest their advice is any better than average advice\n- A distributor has no control over how your investment performs. That's up to the fund management and market.\n\nI consider some of these AMFI distributors to be overpaid tumors on our Indian financial \u0026 investment industry. For what it's worth, I've met AMFI distributors with ARN code, but who recommend Direct plans for clients in exchange for charging a fixed fee (they can't afford a SEBI RIA license) - because removing extra costs increases clients' returns.\n\nThere was a time in late 2000s and early 2010s, when services like FundsIndia made it easy for people to invest. But today, we've so many services making it easy for selecting and investing in funds, that it makes no sense to pay commission to a service that doesn't deserve the fee.\n\n---\n\nI checked out some of  Wealthy's recommendations.\n\nSelecting conservative short-term gives me two funds - ABSL Savings and SBI Savings Fund. One is a money market fund, another is a UST fund.\n\nThere's no justification provided, on what basis these two made the cut. Or, what kind of diversification can be achieved with two of these (as in, what does one fund do that the other one doesn't).\n\nI probably wouldn't recommend these two exact funds, but I'd certainly want to understand the process. To be clear, I'm not saying it's a bad set of funds. They might give gallant returns in next 1-2 years.\n\nBut an investor is expecting something like FD, slightly riskier, but not so much that their capital can be in jeopardy.\n\nWithout thinking too much, people would normally start their search in Liquid and Overnight space. UST funds would come in much later.\n\nI don't disagree that no need to confuse a beginner, that people can have decision paralysis. That's why I recommended FD. It's as simple as logging into your netbanking and a few clicks.\n\nFor an amount of 30k, difference in returns from FD and common Debt funds (Liquid, UST, Overnight) won't make significant impact in corpus size; unless someone's investing in these for a very long time.","Don't insurers ask for details if a person is suffering from pre existing diseases? Adding that detail would have made them not issue policy to that family member.","\u003eBargaining and negotiating are very useful skills in India\n\nI'll have to work on this... I'm way too friendly in bargaining situations üòÖ\n\nThanks again for your advice, I genuinely appreciate it a ton. I'll have to forego the letter though since I really will have no guaranteed source of income while I'm there, rather I'm saving enough money to survive for a year there while pursuing a career in Bollywood(as well as using the extra time of unemployment to fully develop my own personal ventures in music and fashion). Overall I'm pretty nervous since I feel I'm diving into the deep end on this but I'm at least trying to not go in blind by reading up on what I can online(mainly here, quora, and scattered articles). The main areas I'm nervous for are in understanding how things are done differently there financially(not getting fucked over) and culturally(making sure to be respectful and not be an offensive foreigner).\n\nAnyways that was all way more information than you asked for but again, thank you for your help üôÇ","[deleted]","There's a few landlords who are against renting to aspiring actors but not that many. Like I said, all objections are smoothened over by an extra month or two as deposit :)\n\nIn my experience, the process is a lot smoother if you engage a broker to help you find apartments. They charge a month's rent as the fee though.\n\nIf you're looking at Bollywood, you should be looking at the neighbourhoods of Andheri, Juhu etc. which is where most of the aspiring actors stay. If you're looking for more of an expat community, Bandra is the most popular.","FD = Fixed Deposit\n\nYou can either go to a branch, and make an FD of a certain amount and duration. Or, your can log into bank's netbanking and create the FD.\n\nFD is guaranteed product. Bank would take your money and give it away as loan. But if the loans go bad, it's not your headache. Bank would assume the risk and protect you from that.\n\nFDs have a pre-defined maturity period - say, 1 year. Then, 1 year from the date when you make an FD, your FD would mature.\n\nThe amount you'd get in your savings account, is what you had invested earlier, and some x% on top of that.\n\nAs for what would be returns from FD, the answer is _it depends_. FDs with longer duration would have higher interest rate.\n\nExact returns would be in-line with RBI repo rate at the time of opening FD. For instance, currently RBI repo rate is 5.75% p.a. So assume that an FD of 1 year could have returns of 6% p.a., an FD of 2 years would have returns slightly higher than that.\n\nBanks update their FD rates whenever RBI updates the repo rate. To know exact return value, check bank's website or local branch.\n\nAfter you book an FD, you'd receive an FD Advice via email, from your bank. This is a contract note, outlining maturity amount, rate, maturity date etc.\n\nReturn from an FD is decided as per FD rate at the time of opening the FD. And it remains intact until maturity. It's possible while you have this FD with the bank, the interest rates on FDs from the same bank can change (go up or down). But your FD's returns would remain fixed.\n\nThere's a possibility that you might not be able to hold the FD for the entire duration. That, you might need the money because of some emergency, and you'd want it back.\n\nThis is called Premature Withdrawal in FD. It can be done from netbanking or by visiting branch.\n\nTypically, this would attract some penalty. Exact nature and amount of these depend on the bank.\n\nYou'd get your principal back, and some extra amount but less than what was promised in FD Advice.","I've been told to avoid mentioning my career choice by others as well when talking to landlords... Bandra West is where I was originally considering but upon looking further into the matter it does seem quite a lot of the bigger casting agencies and production companies seem to be based out of Andheri West(and the apartments seem nicer quality/affordability than Bandra). I know I've heard Bandra West is a pretty safe area, would you say the same for Andheri? Also would it be cool if I DM'd you a couple other questions I had on the cultural side of things(more specifically to Mumbai if you could offer insight there)? Thanks again!","I'm not sure how you'd get around mentioning your career since that is literally the first question I've been asked by landlords (before even my name). \n\nMumbai, in general, is quite safe - regardless of gender - as long as you take common-sense precautions. In that respect, Andheri is as good as any neighbourhood.

I'm not sure how others will advice but I took Term insurance which doubles up over the period of next 25 years with very slight increase in premium every year. Also, Your term insurance pay does not increase on yearly basis, it increases slightly every 2 months , so you pay different premium if you are 27 years old and 27.2 years old to start a term insurance.

In general, the nominee only gets the proceeds, but does not have ownership of the proceeds. It is to be shared by the right legal heirs. \n\nIf there are not going to be any financial dependents, there is no need for term insurance.  If you would have dependents, then yes, this would be a good time to start. \n\nJust saying - most government rules don't require marriage. e.g An unmarried government employee can claim maternity leave.","Been in for so long now.","Totally upto you.

If you're looking at credit cards for cashback and rewards, the Coral card from ICICI has it in both credit and debit variants and both of them have nearly the same rewards. But if you're looking for Airmiles and other rewards like that, credit cards might have better options. Most of the credit cards have vouchers compensating the joining fees and waivers on annual fees upon crossing certain limit per annum.\n\nThe downsides of credit cards include but not limited to overspending. Most of the debit cards from Visa or MasterCard have international acceptance these days. You don't need a credit card only for international transactions, also the markup charges.\n\nAll in all, I feel you need to be specific about what you're looking at, to get specific suggestions for an objective like rewards or international transactions or acceptability.","Question before I could answer - \n\n1.

On IT e-filing website, there's no option to upload any document with any ITRs, except for a few special cases.\n\nIf IT department has any query or feels the need for further clarification, they'd send you notice asking for specific items.\n\nUntil that happens, just compile and file your tax return.\n\nTax return is a declaration statement, where you're declaring what you've earned and paid taxes on last year. Think of it like writing an affidavit (though legally might not be).","[deleted]","\u003e Starting this FY, these dividends are taxed at 10%.\n\nDividends upto 10L (that's only the sum of dividends, and does not include any other income) are tax free AFAIK, you can double check.\n\n\u003e So I plan to redeem these, and re-invest in ELSS Fund - Direct - Growth option.\n\nWhy do you want to reinvest in an ELSS fund? You can invest in a regular fund and avoid a 3-year lock-in, unless you're using these redemptions to cover your 80C quota (although I'd guess that the redemptions are more than 1.5L - your EPF deductions).\n\n\u003e which ELSS funds are recommended ?\n\nYou can look at this list for some suggestions. https://freefincal.com/best-mutual-funds-2019-quarter-two/\n\nThere are a number of parameters you can look at - consistent top quartile returns is definitely one of them. Downside protection is another. (A fund that has returns of 12% but only a 20% downside in a 2008-like scenario might have a better risk-adjusted reward than a fund with with 14% returns and 40% downside in 2008).\n\n\u003e whether to re-invest in one bulk mode, or do a SIP/STP over 24months ?\n\nFor equity-to-equity, it does not really matter as your total market exposure would remain the same, unless you're changing your risk category. If you believe the market is about to crash, and you're invested in a higher-risk fund and want to move to a lower risk-fund, you might want to do it faster/in bulk. If you're moving from a low-risk to high-risk fund, you might wanna do an STP to average out your buying price. An STP will also reduce your tax liability if you manage to keep your realized LTCG per FY lower, by spreading redemptions across multiple years. (since LTCG/FY upto 1L is exempt).","IRDA doesn't have as much teeth as SEBI or RBI, but at least they monitor liquidity of life insurance companies from time to time. They're also required to maintain deposits.\n\nYou can go for any popular insurer (HDFC Life, ICICI Pru Life, Max Life, SBI Life) for term insurance.\n\nTerm Insurance claim approval is dependent on you. If a life insurer is about to go out of business, someone else would step in and buy that business.\n\nUltimately, all insurers are equally bad, and equally hungry in not having to approve claims.","Might want to ask a lawyer or /r/LegalAdviceIndia","Check [SBI SimplyClick Advantage.](https://www.sbicard.com/en/personal/credit-cards/shopping/simplyclick-advantage-sbi-card.page)\n\nYou get 10x on partner websites like Amazon, BookMyShow, Foodpanda.

This would be my last choice given I can't find the old account details.\n\nI have a few questions about the Simply Click or in general credit cards. Are you being charged extra as a convenience fee for the utility bill payments and insurance monthly? I know IRCTC charges extra for CC anyway, do you have any idea where else it would be extra only because it's CC?","Isn't Amazon card better?","Thanks for the info! No idea this existed. \n\n1.

You'd be filing tax returns for the foreseeable future, at least once a year. It's an important activity and part of being an adult. You should know it well, and be confident enough to do it yourself.\n\nFor what it's worth, there are times when you need professional help. For instance, declaring capital gains or professional income etc. But even then, you should review what the CA has done in preparing the returns, and then accordingly file it.\n\nDon't blindly trust or depend on another person.\n\n\u003e Accountant says if a bank ACC has been included in a filing the previous year, I have to continue to add all the expenses in that account for every subset year.\n\nThat's fine. As per IT act, if you have an Indian bank account in your name, you've to include it in your return filing.\n\nBut even then, why are you hesitant in doing so? Before you got this job, how did that money come to be in that account? I'm guessing you got it from your parents.\n\nMoney given to you by your parents, is tax free. It's a gift, not income. You can declare it in your income tax return as gift, it won't be added to your taxable income.\n\nThis is the whole reason you're filing the IT returns and declaring your income. Otherwise, IT could've assumed your income by tallying up your total assets across all bank accounts you have, and charge you tax directly.\n\nBut if you've received money from other means (selling shares, or selling jewellery, or some side-gig); you'd have to declare that as per prevailing laws in IT act.","\u003e Can I submit only the transactions on the salaried account? Old account contains only personal expenses which are irrelevant since I haven't crossed the slab.\n\nTo be more clear, you don't need to declare any transaction to income tax department. \n\nWhat you declare is income earned by you, money you spend to claim tax deductions like paying life insurance premium, buying ELSS mutual funds etc. \n\nDetailed account of transactions in your bank statement are not submitted or required by income tax department.  IT department isn't interested in your day to day transactions till they suspect that you are evading taxes. \n\nWhen you open the tax form online it will simply ask you declare the total income earned by you from different sources - salary from employer, interest from saving account/FD/loans given/side - business/freelancing etc.\n\nI am guessing that you were not receiving any \"salary\" in your old account.\n\nIf not, at most you need to declare only two things related to old bank account in your tax return form - \n\n1. Interest earned for whole year \n2. Account Number and IFSC code.\n\n\u003e ACC has been included in a filing the previous year, I have to continue to add all the expenses in that account for every subset year.\n\nWhat does your accountant mean by \"expenses\"? It is the term used for business expenses. Personal expenses are not considered for income tax.","[deleted]","IRDA act section 45 new modifications state that paying 3 consecutive premiums mean if the policy is active during the time of insured person's death; the insurer cannot deny the claim on the grounds of non-disclosure.\n\nOther mistake people commonly do, is hiding past medical history from insurance. You should answer all questions in the insurance sign-up form truthfully, and not volunteer any extra information.\n\nFor instance, if you were hospitalized in 2010 for appendicitis, and the form asks for hospitalization history from 2015; you've no reason to volunteer that information. But if you had Dengue and were in hospital for 2 nights (for health insurers to pay up, it's 48 hours minimum hospitalization) back in 2017, you should disclose that.\n\nNext up is reading policy documents carefully. If there are any exceptions or unclear language, better discuss that with your friends-family-doctor; and insurance team as well.\n\nFinally, make sure your nominees are well aware of your policy details; and how to make a claim if you were to die prematurely. For lot of us, death is a taboo subject in family, hence we feel awkward discussing these at home.\n\nNo point in taking an insurance if your nominees have no idea. Insurance is for them, not you. You'd be dead.\n\nIn particular, prepare your nominee(s) on\n\n- what their rights are\n- how to make a claim\n- how to escalate claim rejection to ombudsman or IRDA\n\nYou should set aside some emergency corpus, so that your nominees can continue maintaining their lifestyles in your absence, before the claim is approved. This should be in liquid or semi-liquid form, that they can inherit easily.","For utility payments you can use Amazon Pay for 10x rewards. For train booking simply use Paytm. Website specific charges still apply though, SBI Card doesn't charge anything else on their own.","That's not a secured card against FD.","1. Yes, secured credit card means you'll have to maintain a fixed deposit with the bank and a lien will be placed on it until you return the card. Usually the credit limit would be 70-90% of the FD amount. The minimum FD varies from card to card and bank to bank. \n\n2. Benfits being easy reversals and interest free credit for the bill cycle. The downsides are particularly noteworthy because credit cards might actually make you spend more than what's required turning you into a spendthrift because of the offers/interest free credit/EMIs and such. If you're wise enough and punctual with your payments, it's an extra tool to manage your finances.","I'm not sure why you need to register on TRACES / TDSPC.

Your HR / payroll would already take care of your taxes for you.\n\nNow, you can take advantage of certain tax exemptions written into tax code. But a salaried individual has little room to maneuver here, and therefore even with your best attempts you'd only be able to exclude a small portion of your income from taxability.\n\nInstead of focusing on _not having to pay tax_, focus on growing what you get. You'll more than make up for losses from taxes, if you invest in a disciplined manner in efficient assets.","What is your source of income?\nSalary or Business","The ones holding crypto are actually the ones who are digging the grave of cryptocurrencies\n\nThis shit is not meant to be held.\n\nIts main function is to denote value and work like a currency.

This way I can depreciate it each year and deduct maintenance and service fees from my business expenses. \n* Pay small salaries to your close friends and family, you can collect the money from them either in cash or any other means as so you please. \n* All of my travels are business trips, all expenses I incur during the same goes into my business accounts.

But I can ask.","Yes, if it's a bank, then know that they must operate within RBI regulatory framework. It's not like they can take your money and run!\n\nIt's safe. Just as safe as any other bank.\n\nBut if you want to open a savings account assuming 7% is a great deal, you'd be disappointed.\n\nThis won't be the first time a bank has tried to lure in average retail customers in hopes for higher return, using this tactic. Kotak, DBS, Yes Bank etc. have been doing it for past few years.\n\nEventually, the rates fall once they've achieved their growth and liquidity targets. Would you keep switching to a new bank everytime that happens?\n\nAlso, if you've read the [fine print](https://www.idfcbank.com/personal-banking/accounts/savings-account/faqs/rate-of-interest-on-savings-account.html), you'd see that it's _up to_ 7%.\n\nTo get 7%, you've to maintain more than 1L in that account.\n\nSay, you do keep more than 1L in that account to get the 7% p.a. - assume you've kept 2L in that account.\n\nThen you get 13k / year in interest. Out of this 13k, 3k is taxable (section 80TTA); and you'd pay tax on that from your gains. Your post-tax returns would be less than 6.5% p.a.\n\nBut this is only if you constantly maintain an account balance of 2L or above. If you're sure you can do that, why not go for FD or liquid funds?\n\nIn fact, in case of liquid funds, you won't have to pay any taxes until you withdraw something.\n\nMy view is that 7% is unsustainable when RBI repo rate is 5.75%, given savings account have no incentive to prevent money withdrawal.\n\nBanks take your money, invest in bonds / treasury bills / G-sec etc. They give you back some of it, while keeping a lot of it for themselves. That's how they make money from savings / deposits etc.\n\nIt's difficult to find short-term bonds that are highly liquid at 7% rate today. Either the quality would be bad (the entity getting the loan could have a history of defaulting, though I'm not sure if banks have any legal obligation to not invest liquid money in risky CP/CD etc.), or the bank would have to pay you a part of it from their own pocket, which clearly has an upper ceiling of how long that can go on.\n\nOverall, it's a gimmick. In a few months, they'd have to curtail it down. If you want to invest and generate returns, banks should be the last place to look for.","I've had an account for a year, it pretty great - much better service than HDFC and Axis IMO.","The cashback is 2% if you use it on Amazon Pay and all the merchant Amazon Pay websites. 5% on shopping if you are a prime member. 1% elsewhere.","If you mostly shop on amazon check Amazon ICICI credit card, they have 5% cashback for all shopping on amazon.\n\nSBI simply click will give you 10x points for online spends.\n\nCheck with the bank where you have salary account they will offer you credit card without any documentation or any fees.","cardexpert.in","Citibank, Standard Chartered, ICICI, Axis. \n\nNever go for SBI, it don't care for its customers","HDFC Diners Clubmiles or Regalia.

For old people, medical emergencies can set you guys back quite a bit.\n\nSuperficially speaking, that 5L should be set aside for emergencies (mainly medical ones). Park it in one or two good Liquid / UST funds. You can invest that in one shot, and let it accumulate / grow.\n\nIn fact FD would be fine too, if he's a senior citizen.\n\nMeanwhile, he'd be able to sustain himself and his family on his pension.","When there are way more than 90% of members in unorganized sectors it will always be impossible. \n\nThe percentage needs to drop heavily for that to even begin happening","no","Welcome to bank deposit taxation rules.\n\nUnfortunately, yes. When your FD interest income exceeds minimum TDS amount (10k up to this year, 40k from next year onward), bank deducts TDS to create am entry in your 26AS tax credit statement.\n\nOne common mistake most of us make, is to assume TDS = tax. However, as evident from your experience with this, TDS is only a part of full tax liability.\n\nMain purpose of TDS is to make sure this exact situation happens. Your income gets recorded, and that you cannot file return without paying full taxes you owe. What makes it worse, is that you're paying taxes on gains you've not realized or booked - the FD remains intact!\n\nGoing forward, maybe not keep so much in FD / RD in one single bank. Post-tax XIRR (extended internal rate  of return) would be much lower than advertised rates.\n\nSome would probably want to move that corpus to Liquid / UST funds, because MFs have no TDS, and indexation after 3 years (reduces taxable gains by increasing purchase price). But note that unlike FDs, these aren't completely safe. Higher returns come with slight higher risks.","Lol, no one can predict the future.","In what case is that needed?","Aside from any books / articles you may read, do spend some time reading up on excel / spreadsheet stuff, especially how to compute `PV`, `FV`, `CAGR`, `XIRR`.\n\nFor any investor to have objective math-based approach to investing, it's important to learn these concepts. Nothing fancy, basic skills that you can get from googling or searching on YouTube would be more than adequate.\n\nAs for reading materials, start with [Zerodha Varsity](https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/introduction-to-stock-markets/) and /r/IndiaInvestments wiki.","Used it for a while. Looks good. Great app for free direct investment.\n\nThough I personally use Kuvera, simply because Kuvera has some features (multiple accounts under same log-in, cross-account linking to different log-in, tax harvesting etc.) that I need, to manage investments for myself, my family members, and that of some of my friends as well.\n\nIf Piggy comes out with the features / services Kuvera offers, I'd surely consider it.\n\nFor someone starting out, you'll have to try out whatever you prefer, and see if that fits with your workflow requirements. Don't go by reviews of others.\n\nAs such, all these free direct plan services (Kuvera, Piggy, Groww, PayTM Money) are SEBI registered RIAs, so they have an obligation to not sell your personal and financial data.","AFAIK, Stop loss \"trigger\" doesn't get carry forward next day on Zerodha. \n\nHow stop loss works? Say you bought a share of 50Rs but you also want to sell it if price falls below 40Rs to \"stop\" the loss. This trigger price is valid only before market close that day. \n\nIf your stock didn't reach 40Rs after your order, you now own that share since it is CNC (Cash n carry)\n\n So you own 2 shares of that company and it doesn't matter \"which\" share you sell. While selling, it will only give you option to choose the quantity.","Most probably, yearly basis. \n\nAsk your bank to provide you a interest certificate (may get in from netbanking also) for whole financial year. \n\nIt will contain the interest paid to you via savings, FD or RD. \n\nI personally declare the amount given there in my ITR. Makes things easier.","Yearly basis always even if you get the money after 5 years \n\nIt comes under Income from other sources","Depends on how big your FD corpus is.\n\nThere are, generally speaking, two main ways to report/account your income from FD interest.\n\n- Cash basis\n- Accrual basis\n\nBasically you can choose either, if bank hasn't deducted your TDS. \n\nIf your bank deducts any TDS on interest income, you've no choice but to pay tax every year as long as your FD remains with the bank.\n\nIf interest income is less than a certain limit, bank won't deduct any TDS. This limit is 10k / year on FD interest income (across all FDs in that bank), but last budget, it was revised to 40k / year.\n\n[Refer to this for more info](https://help.myitreturn.com/hc/en-us/articles/219458248-Taxability-of-Interest-income-on-Fixed-Deposit).","This sub has much broader and varied audience, compared to the investment sub.\n\nFinance and investments are topics people don't like to talk about much. It's boring, annoying, and often they'd feel comfortable to just have someone else do it for them.\n\nWe should encourage more participation, and if a thread like this helps do so, so be it.\n\nTo be fair, there are things that you cannot discuss on /r/IndiaInvestments, even if it pertains to personal finance. Because that's a more investment focused sub. This thread is more inclusive in that aspect.","It's a weekly thread with a link to the sub you mentioned. No harm no foul imo \n\nAlso this sub has more coverage so your point is not entirely justified","Put it in a 3-year FD.\n\n50k one-time investment isn't large enough that your choice of asset can make much difference.\n\nFor perspective, a 50k FD generating 6% p.a., in 3 years would become ~59.5k.\n\nAssume you invest that in an equity fund, that gives you 12% return in 3 years, best case scenario (can be higher, but you cannot hope for that when you're investing, because it can be lower too). 50k would then become ~70.2k.\n\nThat's a difference of ~10k over 3 years.\n\nUnless you're investing for very long term, like 8-10 years, equity is generally not recommended.\n\nYou could go with liquid / UST funds too, returns would be similar to an FD. But not sure about your tax situation, so can't comment if it'd benefit you with indexation.","liquid funds","Put it in some good blue chip mutual fund (ICICI Pru).

It definitely won't scale with inflation.\n\nI was hoping he had a pension from state or central Govt.\n\n\u003e What do you mean by Liquid/UST funds.\n\nLike banks, there are MFs that can take your money and loan it to other entities. Unlike banks, they don't protect you from risks of loans. Both risk and returns are yours.\n\nThese are called Debt MFs.\n\nLiquid and UST funds are arguably two of the least risky Debt funds out there. Do google and read up on how they operate.\n\n\u003e Which FD is good for senior citizens\n\nMost banks offer good rates on senior citizen FDs. More than they offer in normal FDs.\n\nCheck with local banks that have good rates for senior citizen FDs.\n\nOverall, I'd rather not give you suggestions / advice, without getting full picture.\n\nIn particular, give more details regarding your parents' finances:\n\n- What are their monthly potential expenses, after retirement?\n- What assets do they have? By assets I mean if they have EPF / PPF / Gold / FD / MFs / stocks / real estate etc.\n- How much would be monthly pension\n\nNow, it's possible you won't feel comfortable sharing sensitive information like this online. That's ok.\n\nYou can PM me as well. Or, post in /r/IndiaInvestments advice thread from a throwaway account, with these details. Or, ask on Discord.","The middle class isn't the one that uses cash the most.","Say, you've a 6% FD in a bank, where you've invested 10L.\n\nA year later, you can have 10.6L (60k in interest income). Since it's crossed the 40k limit of interest income, bank would deduct 10% of this 60k in TDS.\n\nThat's 6k gone from the FD. You now have 10.54L left. Next year, when it compounds, it'd add 6% on 10L + 54k. Not 10.6L.\n\nSo, that's a post-TDS XIRR of 5.4%, even if the FD advertised 6% returns.\n\nExcept, that's not all. TDS isn't your entire tax liability, and you've to 31.2% tax + cess on that 60k income. Only 6k have been sent to IT department. Rest comes from your pocket.\n\nAt this point, your post-Tax XIRR is 4.13%. Rest is eaten up by taxes.\n\nIt hampers compounding by periodically eating into your corpus.\n\nNow, if you'd made 5L FD across two banks - income earned from interest would've been 30k per bank.\n\nFor either of these banks, that's below the limit of interest income which triggers a TDS. So, none of them have any reason to deduct TDS.\n\nYour corpus is 10.6L at the end of the year, you got 6% return and tax never entered into picture. Next year, 6% FD gives you the promised growth on full 10.6L.\n\nYou pay taxes once at the end, after FD matures.\n\nI won't post detailed computation here, but I've done the numbers. You can repeat the same with online FD calculators as well (FreeFincal has one with taxes).\n\nBut gist is this:\n\n- Final corpus size after FD maturity would be higher if you pay taxes each year, on that year's gains. This is called _cash method of accounting_ for tax computation on FDs.\n\n  This is intuitive to understand. You're paying more up front, so you get more at the end.\n\n- Final returns would be higher if you pay taxes only once, at the end.\n\n  Even if final corpus size is lower. This is called _accrual method of accounting_ for taxes on FD.\n\nMy personal opinion is that most people, unless they are retirees and in dire need of safety of investment, don't need to keep more than 1-2L in FD(s).\n\nA good liquid / UST fund combo can do better. More flexible, tax-friendly. But yes, come with some risk.","That's called  **good** '**til cancelled** (GTC) order which isn't available in Zerodha at the moment.","Applied though where?

Calls and texts have come to a stand still. Frustrating af when you're not acknowledged or recognised by someone you're supposedly in a relationship with. Gives rise to a lot of insecurity and other issues.\n\nIts not easy to understand what someone else is going through. There's times when people just shut off for whatever reason. Don't judge them quickly. Despite your reasons to doubt and get angry also give her the benefit of doubt. She took the time out to call and let you know why she's been away. Has she ever given you reason to think she doesn't love you or doesn't want to be with you anymore? Long distance are difficult. Extremely difficult for people who are more physically expressive than verbally. Y'all need to find the strength to understand each other better, be more empathetic and patient towards each other. You clearly know it isn't her fault, so why would you want to punish her? \n\nI've typed out so many texts about wanting to take a break cause she's not been there for me when I really needed her. What I realised is she's going through an extremely difficult time at home and right now she needs my support irrespective of how she acts out. I don't care if this goes through and we end up together or not. I want to feel good that I did the right thing being there for her when she needed me more than I needed her.\n\nI'm not saying it's the same for you. It might also be better for you personally to walk away from this if it's causing your well being more damage than you can take. Understand her situation and what you need from her as opposed to what she can actually give you with whatever is happening on her side. Understand if her situation is going to stay the same or if conditions are going to change. Figure out if you can power through these times and come out the other side, this is better than throwing away a couple years of relationship cause of a few weeks of hardship. Or see if its better for the both of you to not have this dangle over your head. Maybe breaking up will free the both of you from having to feel obligated to keep one extra person happy in life on top of all the shit you have to deal with alone.\n\nThis comment is a mess but imma leave it as is cause I'm too lazy to put it any better right now.","Reported.","Telling people about this works against your anonymity.","[deleted]","Loneliness is a drug too, porn is the antidote","Jobs not increasing proportionally to graduates I think.

You'll work things out if you see this going somewhere serious and long term. \n\nYou'll have to work on your own insecurities and issues irrespective of this relationship or another one. Takes time, support and understanding from both parties involved.  She's decided to be with you and looks like she's doing what she can to make you feel secure. She's doing what is necessary at her end to make it work. You gotta do the same.\n\nAlso, it sucks selling yourself short every time in a relationship. With how things are around us we tend to think being a relationship is huge and we start putting our girlfriends on a pedestal. Move away from that. Be equals. As much as there's a hundred other guys who want to be with her, she's chosen you. Respect that and live up to it. But do not measure your worth based on her acceptance of you. The more secure y'all feel in a relationship the happier y'all will be.\n\nI'm out now. Reddit pe aur relationship advice nai dena. Chill aur troll karna hai. Karo kya karna hai.

You will find very few IT companies, that is if you even consider them IT companies.\n\nYesterday, I went for an interview with this company that seems like an actual IT company. Before I met with the HR, I was asked to fill a form with my details in which I was supposed to fill my expected salary as well. Being a fresher and evaluating my own skills, I wrote 4 LPA. During the interview with HR, he mentioned that expecting this salary would be fair in a city where there are plentitude of IT companies but since this city isn't one of them I l should expect less.

Today, they called to inform me that they want me to come down to the office on Monday and decide on my salary. \n\nTbh I don't care a lot about money provided I get at least 15K per month.

I think there is a similar portion in Sapiens comparing the geographies of Europe and Africa and how it contributed to the rise of Europe. This book is similar, and concentrates on 10 geographical locations - USA/Europe/Russia/China/India-Pak/Africa/West Asia, but is a bit too simplistic IMO.","Completed letters from a stoic by Seneca and Sleeping on Jupiter by Anuradha Roy recently. Reading Aurelius' Meditations and JM Coetzee's In the Heart of the Country now.","**The Idiot** - *Fyodor Dostoyevsky*  \nReally good book, but I feel like his ideas are much better presented in C\u0026P and TBK, and that a lot of what he tries to portray through the characters falls kinda short (at least for me, I couldn't find the characters themselves as compelling as they are in TBK). Still, well worth a read!\n\n**Stoner** - *John Williams*  \n/lit/ meme, but a good one, just like No Longer Human and Notes from the Underground. For some reason, it really reminded me of Siddhartha (probably the \"guy doing shit in his life\" theme and the writing style? I don't know). Really depressing book though, just makes you sit back, sigh, and re-evaluate your life choices when you're done with it :P\n\n**A Hero of Our Time** - *Mikhail Lermontov*  \nMost early Russian novels seem to share a similar tone, and I'd probably slot this in there too? I've not read any Byron, but probably should since the term \"Byronic hero\" turns up a lot when referring to Pechorin. Novels like this seem to kind of almost leave a mark on my mind but not really, like it is unmotivated and dreary to read for the most part, but you still go through with it and \"get\" something from the book even though you're not really into it the entire time. Or something like that, fuck I have no clue what I'm saying.\n\n**Dubliners** - *James Joyce*  \nFucking hell, I'm finally done with this book. I'm probably not reading Joyce again until I feel like my mindset has changed considerably enough to maaaaybe appreciate him. All the short stories were well-written, agreed, but only one or two of the stories actually interested me. Is that the point? Am I shit at this? Probably both, but I'd rather read Nabokov over Joyce if I want good prose.\n\n**Kokoro** - *Natsume Soseki*  \nA Stoner, Siddhartha-ish book. I realize I'm probably generalizing too much, and if you look into the content by itself, they're probably as far apart as possible, but I kinda get the same vibes from these books. I've rated all of the above books as average or just above it, probably going through a phase where I'm not really feeling it, or these particular books are so. Probably re-read some favourites once I'm done with The Gambler which I'm on right now.","Finished: How to Win an Indian Election by Shivam Shankar Singh. The book details his personal journey working on election campaigns for different parties in different states. He talks about the flow of money into politics, how insanely expensive campaigns are and how it leads to the businessman-politician nexus, the use of propaganda, fake news on WhatsApp, and how parties exploit communal faultlines for electoral gains. The last bit was my favourite. He went into detail about how Ibobi, the CM of Manipur, created a division between the Nagas and the Meiteis to win the state election. Riveting. \n\nFinished: The Verdict - Decoding India's Elections by Prannoy Roy. This book was essentially a bunch of statistics with explanations. Some interesting points were the three different phases of the Indian voter(pro-incumbent, anti-incumbent and presently, 'wise'), the dramatic increase in female turnout, the lack of representation of Muslims (and the reason behind it), why alliances matter so much, how polling works. Very relevant book right now!","Crime and Punishment padh raha tha, beech me chhod diya. Don Quixote bhi 370 pages ke baad chhod diya.\n\nKuch accha suggest karo.","Just started A thousand splendid suns by Khaled Hosseini. Some 60 pages in and plot has started moving forward. He paces his stories really well.","I'm reading Manufacturing Consent, and to be honest I find it underwhelming. Chomsky has presented his case as to why media is a propoganda tool using case studies but I find it tiresome. Is it supposed to be like that or am I doing it wrong? How should I approach the book? And what other works of his should I read or prioritise?","Reading At the Existentialist Caf√© by Sarah Bakewell.","I just want to say all of you guys read really great books especially non-fictions. Keep reading. The best inspiration to read more comes from people who are reading.","Rereading ASOIAF to relish the brilliant writing after the disappointing final season of GoT. The writing in the final seasons looks mediocre due to the rushed plot.","Reading India after Gandhi, The End of India and The Red Queen.","Reading Debt: The first 5000 years by David Graeber.","Reading debriefing the president by John Nixon.","How do you guys read your books? I have the habit on binge reading which I am starting to feel is counter-productive. I finish a book quickly which helps me in reading more books but then I feel that this does not allow me to absorb the book properly. Any thoughts on this?","Reading two books\n1. India after Gandhi, 30% done. Timing couldn't have been better due to elections. \n2. Mahabharath for kids. Also listening to Mahabharath Podcast by Lawrence Manzo, while commuting to office. Pretty good, graphic in nature, than I expected. Hence two versions of story in parallel","I am currently reading The Argumentative Indian by Amartya Sen. It has been a great collection of essays 1/3rd into the book. Anyone else read it? I am also reading waking up by Sam Harris","I'm reading nationalism by Rabindranath Tagore. It's so relevant, especially in times like these.","Finished hereticus and currently reading malleus. Both by Dan abnett. I've been obsessed with 40k universe for a while now. Too bad the black library prices the books too steep.","Reading this really nice account of the early internet (part of which is the domain Sex.com), and it's a pretty intriguing work. The Players Ball by David Kushner.","Just started Memories of Ice after re-reading Deadhouse gates, that i left midway for some reason. Also got the first part of The Prince of Nothing series. Will take a break after MoI and read this.","Les Miserables: 40% read. It's a great book, with a look at the society through the eyes of a reformed convict in France through the French revolution. Has some deep insights on how society in general functions.  \n\nWorm by Wildbow: 21% read. The book was great for the first 1200 pages. It's starting to slow down and getting repetitive with fights being described in fine details. I am sticking with it for now in hopes of it getting better. \n\nThe Wise Man's Fear: Almost halfway through and I think it's even better than The Name of The Wind.","Reading: **The Master and Margharita by Mikhail Bulgakov.** 50 pages in, it a great book but slightly difficult, still loving it. I'm coming of a Dostoyevsky phase, and getting more into Russian literature.\n\n**Conversations with Friends, by Sally Rooney.** Easy simple read, something I go to when I'm getting bored with more serious books.","Finally got around to writing down my thoughts about the books I read in 2018: https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/books-2018/\n\nWith 30 books, 2018 definitively was a good year!","Reading sacred games. The writing is very pot boilerish, though some of the backstories are way more detailed and interesting than the TV series. It's a breezy read and I don't anticipate the book lingering in my mind after I complete it. Can easily be finished over a weekend.","I have recently gotten into meditation as a way to calm intrusive thoughts  \n\n\nFound this gem and it is free for all   \n [http://www.shinzen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/FiveWaystoKnowYourself\\_ver1.6.pdf](http://www.shinzen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/FiveWaystoKnowYourself_ver1.6.pdf)","Finished Queenslayer, the latest book in the Spellsinger series. Quite a nice read. It is written by Sebastian de Castell, who also wrote the Greatcoats series, which is a must read for fantasy lovers.\n\nFinished a couple of books from the Licanius trilogy - which is also quite nice. It is unlike most of the fantasy books that you will have read, and the magic system is quite similar to Sanderson ( I believe the author was inspired by Sanderson)\n\nStarted reading the Books of Babel. A couple of chapters into the first book. Reads like a steampunk novel.","I listened to Tom Sharpe's Wilt series. The first book was funny. Rest of them were tedious.\n\nI watched the films based on his books Porterhouse Blue and Blott on the Landscape earlier. Both were nice.","For those of you who are interested in the reading club I mentioned earlier (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpaan5/are_you_interested_in_being_part_of_a_reading), I will post a new story on Sunday.","Has anyone read Family Planning\nby Karan Mahajan? It recieved great reviews. I am halfway through it, initially it was very funny but now it seems like a drag. Should I continue reading it? \n\n\nWas also reading the short stories collection \nA Day in the Life by Anjum Hasan. Some stories are great,  some are okayish. \n\nI bought another book:  The Kind Worth Killing by Peter Swanson. Will read it next.","Any suggestions for non fiction books about Russia? I find the country fascinating.","I started reading James Clear's ATOMIC HABITS. Also listening to Charles Duhigg's Power of Habits. Similar books but I need start my life anew.","As someone who wants to start reading again, what books would you guys recommend? I have short attention span, so I'd prefer not so complicated fiction. I started reading Murder of Roger Acroyd today. I don't think I like crime genre that much.","if you're working in art/the creative field and insecure/lost/need some sort of clarity and understanding that most motivational and self help books don't provide then [art and fear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fea) is a book worth checking out. to be honest i just flip through it when i'm going through phases of doubt and why the fuck am i doing this. it digs into your feelings of fear, and reminds you of why you're still here.\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nif you need the ebook hmu\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nhas anyone read anything by herman hesse that isn't siddhartha? i've been reading the glass bead game on and off. i'm digging the straightforward narration of something that comes from a spiritual context, but still deals with a narrative of progression and growing up, world building and creating societal structures. it's quite similar to siddhartha in the way it handles human relationships and doesn't have very detailed 'showing' of human interaction and the intricacies of conservation, but gives you direct yet meaningful dialogue and is more interested in the larger inner workings of a person. actually it's a really good example of writing about the way other people are mirrors into ourselves. and also it's one of those books that keep you in perspective of the larger picture. although i do have questions about the world itself, and also there's a lack of the presence of women which is definitely very evident i mean i understand that it is about a larger perspective that all of us ultimately experience but it does have some very heavy world building so i wonder what the reason is.\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nany sort of dystopian recs by indian writers with a story that doesn't take itself too seriously but is still self aware? something bizarre and fun. that is a little specific but i don't know i just have a very specific plot in mind and i know i won't find something like it, maybe i should write it hmm...","Just finished Elantris by Brandon Sanderson. My first book of his. What a ride! No wonder people gush about him.","Completed Koh-I-noor by William Dalrymple and Anita Anand. The book basically follows the journey of the now famous diamond and its illustrious owners including Babur and later Mughal Kings, Nader Shah, Ahmed Shah Durrani, Ranjit Singh, Duleep Singh, Lord Dalhousie and of course Queen Victoria. The initial sections of the book is boring, partially because there aren't many first hand sources. Once we reach to Durrani and Ranjit Singh we get multiple perspectives and the book and the writing becomes stronger.\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nCurrently reading 5 books simultaneously\n\n1. **Ambiguity Machines by Vandana Singh** (science fiction short story collections) - I started reading this is Feb, but I need breaks after each story. Currently finished some 5 stories with 5-6 more to go. Reading short story collections tend to be my weakness as it often takes me longer to complete than novels. \n2. **Man without Fear by Rajat Gupta** \\- This is the one I am quickly trudging past. Should be done by next week. I have read Caravan's profile on Rajaratnam case and how Anil Gupta basically swindled money in the name of his poor Indian maid. Rajat Gupta barely surfaces in that story. So I was interested to know his side. Basically I don't buy his arguments that he is a victim by the larger machinery. Still I am happy I made the choice to read this book as you get to know the inner workings and life of consultants/partners at Mckinsey\n3. **Kathakal by Unni R** \\- Short story collection by Unni R (Yes, reading another short story collection. And like Ambiguity Machines the reading is often on and off)\n4. **Mythos by Stephen Fry** \\- There is only one thing that would get me to walk for at least an hour every day. And that's Stephen Fry telling tales of Titans, Gods and Demi Gods. Listening to it on Audible\n5. **The Water Cure by Sophie Mackintosh** \\- This is a strange book, in a good way. Almost like Handmaiden's tale but also very different in execution.

Ek ted-ed ka video hai uspe. Dekh use. Padhne ka motivation milega dobara","I actually love the book more than Kite Runner. It only keeps getting better as it switches perspectives and time period.","Why do you think that media doesn't \"manufacture\" consent? I haven't read the book but read some excerpts. But I don't see a case against the idea. It may have changed now as the monopoly for information broadcast is diluted due to social media but in 2000s and all, it was absolute. Even now for most of us, the news we consider authoritative comes from TV news or newspaper. They just dont tell us what happened, they tell us what we are supposed to feel if we are concerned citizen. Eg. post pulwama news coverage. \n\nThe media also sets the agenda. If media decides to cover the good deeds of one party \u0026 doesn't cover others, people think that other parties are just sitting idly in their AC wale offices \u0026 doing nothing. This too is as pernicious as media bias in reporting.","I felt the same reaction from Understanding Power. Many of his revelations have aged in this age of information I feel, plus we are reading it way forward in time.","Firstly, I think Manufacturing Consent is something of a thesis where Chomsky et al prove their findings with exhaustive and irrefutable data. For me, I feel like I read a lot of opinions compared to rigorous analyses. If you're looking for something that's less about details and more about the larger picture, consider some of his essay books. (Powers and prospects)\n\nAlso, it ties into Chomsky's larger narrative that the US has been and continues to be empire/neo-imperialist without a lot of people recognizing it as such beyond trivially dissing the Iraq invasion. Through this he adds the piece about how such a country's media comments on its foreign affairs. Most of us know on some level that media reporting is biased, but mostly we view it through the lens of left/right. The book tries to show how systemically the media abandons its 'values' to protect the *state's interests*. \n\nMost of all, I love his dry takedowns of the type of language that is used for propaganda. 'Oppressing people's vs 'Genocide', promoting 'Free market' while having enacted many closed doors policies over the years etc. I find his essays have a lot more of this type of stuff. Read his essays about Chile, East Timor, and my favorite stuff is always around the Israel-palestine conflict.","What you want is a grand narrative. For that read Necessary illusions this one is more incidental and lecturey or Inventing reality By Pareneti. Or responsibility of intellectuals.","Halfway through book 1 myself; watching the series definitely allows me to keep track of the characters in the book.","I have started reading ASOIAF too! About 70% into the 1st book. I haven't watched the series, but the books are really good. He sure knows how to keep the readers interested even with such large books.","ASOIAF is so much fun uhhhh. I love fantasy. I read the first two books back in college.

I hope its a good read.","This idea is not new it was presented years back by Polyani in the Great Transformation.","I was like this and I felt the same as you do. Since last year, I have started picking up multiple books at the same time but very different lengths. So last year, I was reading War And Peace throughout the year and this feels like the best way to absorb a book of such dimensions. On the side, I read relatively smaller books that can still give me a sense of closure every month while I tackle the bigger one at a different pace.\n\nThis year, I have picked up Les Miserables and Worm by Wildbow which are both long enough to sustain me throughout the year. And I am reading smaller books on the side.","There is this History of India podcast by a British guy. If you haven't, check it out. You may like it.","I read Sen's book about 5 years ago.

Thanks","There's a book too going by the same name written by Sunil Khilnani.","No one needs anything to discredit Sam Harris except the second edition of his first book The End of Faith. The book opens with a description of a hypothetical terrorist attack involving a suicide bomber with nails in his pocket. After a page or so of bad prose, Harris innocently asks why is it \"so trivially easy - you-could-almost-bet-your-life-on-it easy [pointless dashes are in the original] - to guess the young man's religion?\"\n\nWell that statement is footnoted in the second edition and states \"some readers may object that the bomber in question is most likely to be a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam\" aka the Tamil Tigers who are Hindu secularists. Not so \"trivially easy\" then, but of course he relies on the fact that his readers, like him, are islamophobic idiots who don't check footnotes or know the first thing about Islam or terrorism and just assume terrorism equals Islam.\n\nThis is all one needs to discredit this fucking idiot, but he continues.\n\nAfter this breathtaking admission that the first page and a half of his book is prejudiced and functionally racist bullshit, the footnote continues and seemingly out of nowhere he starts attacking the work of R.A. Pape who describes the Tamil Tigers as secular (as does everyone else, even the Tamil Tigers). Sam says since they're Hindus they're religiously motivated, end of story.\n\nNow, the reason Sam attacks Pape and makes this really outlandish claim is because Papes's research totally discredits Sam's entire premise because he demonstrates that even so called Muslim extremists have essentially secular concerns, especially the presence of the United States military on their land. Sam ignores this and gives us another truly stupid and racist take. \"Secular Westerners often underestimate the degree to which certain cultures, steeped as they are in otherworldliness, look upon death with less alarm than seems strickly rational.\"\n\nNote that the \"Secular West\" certainly doesn't describe the United States which has more religious fundamentalists than pretty much any middle eastern country, including in the US military given that many higher ups are in the Knights of Malta. Somehow this doesn't mean that all the United States' terrorism is religiously motivated. Sam is just erecting  a giant double standard: if a group has members of a religion in it it is religiously motivated, unless it's in the \"Secular West\". Since the \"Secular West\" doesn't include America, and of course he means to include America, we can only conclude he means white majority countries. And given that every culture not in the Secular west, or in it but that doesn't matter to Sam, has a religion, people in brown countries are crazy/evil, people in white countries aren't. That's Sam Harris' career in a nutshell.","I consider myself liberal but one of my friends who I consider as the most liberal person who I know personally, gets defensive when I criticise religion.","I think you are being too critical here. He is a person associated with science communication and a neuroscientist.\n\nI guess you think like my friend I was talking about. Being critical about Islam makes you illiberal and racist and bigot.\n\nHe opposes the Republican and Trump's ideology.\n\nI know even I am not a big fan of his spiritualistic arguments.

I'd recommend you read the first if you don't mind flat characters and a simple writing style, and would like a nice magic system though."],"permalink":"/r/india/comments/bua58k/biweekly_books_articles_discussion_thread_290519/","author":"ppatra","title":"Bi-Weekly Books \u0026 Articles discussion thread 29/05/19","distinguished":null,"upvote_ratio":0.87,"score":46}

So, take care yourself physically and MENTALLY!","I should be thanking reddit as it was a precursor to my recovery. I joined it last year. And it was in one of these threads I vented about my mental health. I did it twice and  the response turned out to be life-changing. Internet has some power and I got some relief that my concerns were legitimate. When people on internet are ready to listen to your story it gives you inner satisfaction which you can't even get from your friends and family.\n\nWent for therapy (2 sessions). Got out of toxic friendships. Stayed mostly on my own, made new friends. Tried new hobbies, started reading books again (I hadn't read any in past four years). Earlier whenever I used to talk about my story, I would start crying. Now I don't feel like it. \n\nDepression does some real damage to your brain. It caused me epilepsy and my parents thought it was due to my studying habits. Not all parents or friends are good. Some people are inherently good (you'll be lucky if you happen to find one), some are inherently bad and some are in-between and they are the worst kind. This society has made us believe that other's approval is far more important than our own. Add social media, career, relationship, looks and the concoction would be enough to cause anyone some amount of injury to mental and emotional health. \n\nI see my friends venting about how their lives are unfair. I can give them sympathy and offer some solutions. But it is up to them to come out of this pain. \n\nLife is short, really short. You don't know when you're going through a good phase of your life. And life is strange too. It makes us confuse our priorities. When there's some health issue our lives get even more complicated. Not all people can afford therapy or cut people from their lives (kyuki circumstances). Time cannot heal your wounds. You have to heal it on your own. \n\nOne thing I did a lot was writing everything about my life. Keeping your thoughts to yourself causes more injury. If you feel like you'll be judged or something, type it down and don't read it. Write about every single event that embarrassed you, angered you. One can't keep on adding water to the already full cup. You will have to empty it out at one point.","I'm trying to escape from my partially emotional abusive dad, by staying in a PG near work. I've told my Mom about my intention, she's still processing it. I've given the false reason that there's a lot of workload and commute time, but actually I don't feel comfortable at home. It feels like I'm walking on eggshells. After a recent confrontation where I told I'm depressed, I don't talk to my dad much, so the outburst and abuse towards me has reduced now.  I want to feel free, and achieve my dreams.  Are there any repercussions to be scared of?","I don't feel motivated to do anything. I masturbate almost every 2 hours. I sleep most of the time.

Started eating outside almost everyday. Luckily got a good job amid all these. Thought things will change.\n\nBut, Got diagnosed with IBS( Irritable bowel syndrome) last year,  Vit D and B12 deficiency this year. Got a minor surgery done recently. Spent almost 1L on hospitals in 8 months. \n\nDon't have anyone to share my feelings. Still cry very often. Just living one day at a time, hoping things will get better.","I literally have 0 friends.

And now, sometimes, it gets difficult meeting new people and unwillingly telling them about your \"hard times\", but it's ok. I know people have it real bad.

How should I keep my mental health safe in the long run?","[Rant, not so serious] \n\nI am so done with this country. My mother is a pseudo-modern person. She will call me boring or that I have a really bad fashion sense, etc. I just like wearing plain clothes, jeans with a t-shirt, you know, casual stuff. She hates that I don't wear 'modern' clothes. Well, I would if I had a chance to because I don't really have time to dress up and enjoy. That's fine, I liked the fact that my mom at least doesn't jab about someone wearing something revealing or whatever. I was wrong. Dead wrong. There were some WhatsApp posts where pictures of girls in normal shorts and tank tops are being circulated, the crime was their bra was quite visible (back or straps), she started laughing and it went like this-\n\n\"Will you wear this!? Why even bother wearing something, they should just step out wearing the bra\".\n\nI was shocked. MY mom said this. The one who calls me plain and boring for wearing Jeans and t-shirts. \n\nI argued with her, \"What's wrong with that? Why aren't you shaming the people who took the picture without any permission and circulating pictures for wearing clothes totally reasonable for weather like 37¬∞C?\"\n\nMom : \"She didn't reach a level to wear such clothes. What has she done in her life to wear it? \"\n\nMe : \"Why does one have to prove something to wear clothes according to comfort? One should wear anything he/she wants to. Maybe that's why other countries are more developed. They don't hold such views\"\n\nMom : \"You first bring better marks then talk. That's the only thing you are good at, arguing. That's all you can do. Become something first, then speak. You can't prove anything\".\n\nDoes someone's opinion only matter when they have a so-called respected profession or are the topper of a school? My mother is someone I love, especially because my father is an alcoholic. Now I'm questioning everything. Is my mother actually the person I think I know? I used to let the snide remarks go, \"As if you'll become the best in XYZ activity\", then she'll claim that she never said anything like that. She has been through a lot, because of my father and her in-laws. I always thought she was the nicest person I ever knew. Now I can see black streaks of Islamophobia and hypocrisy in what I thought was a golden canvas. When I think about it, my mother has never apologized for anything she has ever done wrong, ever.\n\nKeep in mind she made me wear a dress which was totally backless, till the end. The visibility of bra apparently changes everything. She'll also remark about how I don't have enough confidence to wear that dress maybe I shouldn't have tried it out, after all. She'll pest me for not having a boyfriend and then shame any girl who hangs out with guys. She'll shame my sister's boyfriend for not being successful (He has a job in finance department, he doesn't make a lot but he has just started earning and treats my sister with respect and love, unlike my father). My mother would rather be with my alcoholic father than a loving person who is not as financially stable.\n\nMy mother is one of them. The society.","I'm going no where in my career.

I'm not very active here so idk if this happens every week. Noticed today.","Seriously move out. It doesn't matter if it's your family, being with someone toxic isn't worth it. I had to move out at 15 because of physically and mentally abusive parents and life has been better since then. My parents are nice now though. Guess my absence changed them.","yeah you should move out....maybe stay with some friends at pg as it would cheer you up and keep you company and stay strong you will have the best of times ahead.","There can only be one alpha in the house.

There was this chic that puffs out her chest when she notices me staring at it. I thought it meant something but I was wrong.\n\nIve seen a couple other girls do it to me although I'm not attractive.

No friends, cannot connect with people and online friendships seem so plain now, though they used to be my bread and butter back in my teens.\n\nI'd say, the deal breaker here is having a social media presence, one which is carefully planned, maybe put some hindi memes and random shit on your insta, like and comment random stuff on people either in your school or college circles.\n\nHaving no friends isn't as bad as it seems, you don't have to take out time from your schedule for outings, parties or long ass calls but you need to replace that free time with something you love, so when you look back, you don't regret it too much.","Talk to parents buddy.","Why don't people move out? Marriage is too great a deal to do on your parent's terms.","One of my friends (who's a Jat) wants to marry a girl (who's also a Jat but different gotra), and yet his parents are not agreeing to it readily.","Classic emotional blackmail.

Your aim isn't to clear the exams, your aim is to get to the position you dearly wanted.","Man, this exam isn't everything. We know our worth. It can't be evaluated by one exam, where luck plays bigger role than it should. Also, there are other venues to serve the society. In fact, they are better than joining the services.","A long walk , an activity totally unrelated to your career and different, such as an art museum or a spiritual experience","Doodling, trying out new music genre, taking care of plants (it's super effective), organizing closet/desk, writing everything that has happened on paper/doc has helped a lot in reducing anxiety. Even keeping a check on what and when you eat is also good. What you eat has an impact on your emotions and vice versa.","Talking to your own image in a mirror, while giving rational arguments.\n\n\nYeah, talking to yourself is crazy, but if it helps keeps you off that edge of breakdown, why not?\n\nIt has slowly become something of an constant presence now to me, whenever I pass that mirror, I smirk or smile into it, and feel as if that old image of mine is smiling back at the demons we defeated.","A person with social anxiety is seen as a weak and an inept person who usually gets trampled and used by others. A man with social anxiety is more looked down upon than a woman with social anxiety.","They call you fattu","All I can say is that it is not getting the attention it needs.","It doesn't exist in India, cause no one talks about it in open and no would understand.","Pardon me since I don't remember the timeline for 12th standard anymore, nor do I remember having projects etc, the main driver that I remember were the final board exams we had in March? And some internal marks which were heavily influenced by being a teachers pet.\n\nSo assuming those conditions, you can utilize the resources you have at hand, the internet, classmates or friends, relatives etc to shave down your work load in the school, and spend some more time with your mom and make it enjoyable if you both have an affectionate relationship. You can also talk about your predicament with cancer survivors or patients on reddit to understand what you can do to help.\n\nFor your own personal mental help, I'd suggest talking with anyone, online or irl on a daily basis and share what your day was like truthfully, and how you felt about it. The better the listener, the more it would help you look at your day introspectively.","I feel really sorry for you and your mom. As for the projects, I believe that your school teachers can postpone your submission to some extent. And don't feel bad about asking for help for your mates. It's okay. Take your time, and don't worry, in the long run it'll be alright. Be with your mom.","Start writing a diary. Take some time out of your day and sit at a calm place. Write down all the thoughts that come to mind. Write down major things that happened on that day. Don't be analytical while writing down. Don't judge your thoughts while you are at it. Just let them flow in to your paper.","I think what you're saying is very prevalent. Specially the \"proving yourself through a high paying job or some other way so you can enjoy some unrelated comforts in life\" that Indian parents do. It's become a part of the society now,easily visible when people are intrinsically aligned to judge a person's worth with their earning and so most people also get into fields where it is more likely rather than taking risks and going for what they're interested in. It's a part of why so many other countries people don't mind doing part time jobs and full time jobs as what we consider being inferior like working at McDonald's or something and be happy. One of my friend is in Australia and he is intelligent and just finished his degree so he can teach in primary school and he seems really happy about it. I cannot imagine that in Indian context because it is seen as inferior to engineer,finance,doctor or such jobs. (Even besides the fact that teachers here get paid low)\n\nUnrelated rant aside,I hope you get the means to move out soon through college. And be happy in the end,whether that's through earning as much as she thinks you can't or just being happy otherwise without the validation. Regarding your mom,I think other comments handle it better. Maybe her opinion might change bit by bit,but it's unlikely,and in the case that you do prove it to her as she says,do remind her that you still think that you Didn't actually need to do it, otherwise she might feel she was right all along :P","Your mothers seems like a very controlling person and wants everyone around her to do things the way she wants them to happen.\n\nYou mentioned in the other comment, you are in 12th grade. You are young. Work hard and get a decent paying job so that you can move out of your home as soon as possible. She will not able to control every aspect of your life, then. You will have your own freedom and maybe it could improve  your relationship with her. Also, try if you can get admission in a college in a different city than yours. At the age of your mother, people rarely change, in fact their bad values and behaviours become more entrenched. You can try talking sense to her whilst standing your ground. (How's your relationship with your sister? Keep her on your side.) Good luck.","Time heals a lot of wounds and changes many minds . While you will bear the brunt of her toxic taunts and expectations, that doesn‚Äôt mean you stop living your life. It‚Äôs hard but possible.. I sometimes get bad comments from near ones and would lash out but realized that time heals and teaches both me and them to be better persons","You shouldn't grudge her for that. I am not really disappointed anymore when ny mother does this. We are all a sum of our generation, and it takes great courage and strength of character to be better men, or women. Our parents grew up in a time when wearing revealing clothes like your backless was major taboo. My mother does this to other girls all the time, the faces she makes and the comments she passes. My father is kind of a misogynist and a closet Hindutva supporter. It's them. They have changed over the time, but their visceral nature cannot change, no matter what you do or say. Don't beat yourself over it.\n\nBut, yeah, I am truly disappointed and saddened when our generation does this.","You already know the answer to your solution, get a hobby or skill be it sports or any technical skills by this you will meet many like minded.\nDon't isolate yourself","Develop skills. Do some self study and practice it.","Bhai, koi bhi extremely talented nahi hota. Talent is an excuse other people make for your hardwork. You try your best. It's not bad working at a company, sab koi aetists, speakers ya leaders nahi hote. Tujhe jo karna hai kar. Aur pyaar hum sab hai, baat kar. Sex chahiye toh paisa laga.","Dude, in regards to mediocrity, we are all mediocre in the end, since neither of us owns a multi billion dollar company, hasn't been to the moon nor did any of us invent a generation defining technology.\n\nYou are you, and you can only be compared to yourself in the end. If the you today is better than what you were yesterday, you're good. If you're the same, you're stagnating, and if you're doing worse, then you're regressing and that's all there is to it.\n\nPyaar and stuff is a different issue, if you've got money then reducing your strike zone a little lower and splurging a little on a lady may get you some loving, but the *true love* shenanigans are a rare occurrence. Can't look for it, shouldn't chase it.\n\nYou're in a comfortable spot right now, you have a job, a good educational record and from what you've said, a decent family backing. There is an extensive amount of things you can do! And there is way way more to look forward to.","\u003e\u0009wasted your life \n\nMy life was also a waste, my past will look like a waste hopefully if I can make my tomorrow meaningful and happy.  It‚Äôs all in my hands how I feel and what I consider worthwhile goals.","Look back, reflect. Why did you get Ds? What were the variables? What went wrong?\n\nWas the paper not as expected, your motivation lacking, maybe you were struggling with something else?\n\nIs it fixable? Can you do better?\n\nRemember, it's not over till you decide it is.","Hello there. I am in 12 grade too. I get you, you shouldn't care about what other's think about you. Just concentrate on the other subjects which are causing you to fuck up. You don't have to prove anything to anyone. Maybe, check in with a therapist.  Smoking at such a tender age is not good. You are probably too stressed. As a daughter of a chain smoker, I request you to stop smoking. It's only a temporary solution. Just work on yourself. Maybe you are just irritated with everything, like me. It gets tiresome and monotonous sometimes. \n\nMy maths is bad too now. My confidence is at an all time low. PM me if you need to rant. Have a good day.","This is me spot on. Freelancing took a toll on me big time. I have an appointment as well in a few days.","Been there.\n\nScrewed my entrance exams when i was 17. Was in your position. Felt that I let down my parents. Felt that I let myself down. Future didn't seem bright at that time.\n\nBut I picked myself up. Joined one of those coachings. And came back strong.\n\nYou may want to give up. But before giving up you need to give it a tough fight. You have all the time you need. Get your shit together and start now.","Requesting you to make a separate post as this thread is unstickied.","Do you want to elaborate more on this?\n\nWhy do you feel as such? Is it a lack of attraction to your SO, the burden of society, maybe some past issues that plague you?\n\nSometimes just talking about it, even if it's difficult to understand, makes it easier.","Maybe people are reporting it more now.","Peer pressure,  competition everywhere, unhealthy food habits, fucked up sleep cycles, lonelines and isolation (mainly because we have stopped communicating in real life),","This may shed some light to your question:  [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/04/what-is-depression-and-why-is-it-rising](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/04/what-is-depression-and-why-is-it-rising)","Check practo or jd","Try to spend some time outside the house, maybe meet friends. Will improve your state of mind.","Many times even I feel there is no one left for me to love. I have grown emotionally distant due to many events and people (and none of them were related to romance). Because of it maybe I haven't been able to love anyone. \n\nBut because of this I have realised my own worth. I love myself more than anything now (not in a narcissistic way though). \n\nEven if no one is there for you, you will always have yourself; and only yourself. Because even the person who loves you the most will only come till your grave, but won't step in with you. \n\nTake a solo trip, or even a small solo outing. Enjoy your company. Treat yourself. You deserve all the love in this world.","Try sitting down when angry. It'll help","Requesting you to make a separate post as this thread is unstickied.","Chances are, you are hitting a cap at what you can do for yourself. Try to branch out, instead of watching TV or traveling during leisure, try reaching out to an NGO and help them with their activities.\n\nMaybe pick a part time home tutor job if you used to be great in studies, or look after the kids of your friends.\n\nSometimes, helping others makes life mean so much more. When you get that little gratitude which is borne out of your individual effort, it makes you realise that you made a difference, no matter how little.","Where and how did you get to move out at 15? Are you staying with them now?","NEET and living alone on parents money after annihilating savings on hookers overseas.\n\nI don't want to work, it makes me more of a habshi.","...

We have to submit 4 projects, 2 in June and 2 in September. These were the internal marks you were talking about.","Thank you for helping. Yes she is controlling but her life was pretty much hellish. My father is abusive and is only under control when I am around him. If I leave, things won't be pleasant. As for my sister, we aren't great friends and she's a bit spoiled. Not exactly my role model but she has suffered a lot so I don't blame for being a free bird after leaving my parents.","I don't hold any grudge. I love her a lot.

Also, thank you.","Thank you, but it's all done now. It was the last semester on college (will have internships and placements only now) and I took it a little lite. Thought worst case I'll get C/C- and 1 D max. But it ended up being a massacre, and this hurts man.","I love rants. But the thing is there is no subject I'm week in, maybe a bit in Maths. It could have been any other subjects too, depending on my 'brealdowns'. I know smoking is bad, and I don't smoke on a daily basis, and I'm trying my best to cut down. About the proving anything to anyone bit, I don't really care about other people to prove anything or worry about it. Yeah, I'm thinking aboyt going to a therapist this month.","How did freelancing affect you? Please let me know. And it's great that people are coming forward with their mental health and seeking help.","I like your username.","And the constant comparison we have now, mostlybecause of social media. An hour on Instagram always makes me feel like I'm living a boring unhappy life and FOMO.","Yo have really out it well, I sometimes wish that it would have been better if there was no mobile, it is destroying many youth's life slowly, like a slow poison..","That's anice post! Thanks for sharing.","Moved to a different city for college. Still in the same city. I go home like once in few months.","Sorry to hear that, on the brighter side you were at least able to get a job and get some money saved to experience sex, which many of NEETs can't do. \n\nHow was the experience with Hookers? Good, bad or meh?","Make a post on here, describing yourself, your interests, you outlook on life, etc. I am sure many would reach out to you, and definitely something nice would come out to talking to us strangers on the reddit.","The social media bit is quite damn hard indeed yeah. Is it the drive that you lack or the time?\n\nAlso don't worry about the too late on regrets part, it's human to have regrets, I swear I regret nearly every little thing I do, from years ago to what I did yesterday. What matters is that if I can set that regret aside and keep going.\n\nAvoiding extremely heavy regrets, such as when I stopped contacts with the only friend I have ever had just because I found it too burdensome is one of the heavier regrets that I struggled to move past, cause that could have been a huge difference.","It does. If it helps I went through the same thing. Even though I had friends, I felt lonely most of the time. It's ok if you feel embarrassed to talk to your parents, I am sure they would understand. Though my parents didn't understand what I was going through, at least they were there when I needed someone to talk to or cry.","I think awareness campaigns are a great way to propagate the value of mental health. In schools, they should be educated or counselled (workshops work too) about such issues. \n\nMaybe a star figure can bring more attention to it too.\n\nElvis Presley brought more attention to vaccinations by being vaccinated in front of media. Number of people vaccinated rose upto 90%. Honestly, I am just a teenager so I don't think I have the best ideas to help.","Maybe your father keeping your mother under his control and abusing her caused her to change and be this way. Violence and abuse do tend have a cycle. People who were bullied and abused tend to do that to others as well. It would be tough to change her ways. It is doable though. Right now she sees you as a child and doesn't value your opinions and views much. Through time, maybe she will become accepting of you. \n\nI'd suggest you posting this as a query of r/TwoXindia, women there might be able to help you more as we guys are a bit low on emotional intelligence and handling problems related to it.","Hey, it might be a little difficult to swallow but what's done is gone.\n\nAll you can do is make the best of what you've got. Maybe pick up random skills on the internet, build up your resume. Not many companies Gate keep on CG bases, and those which do are usually not that high.","It's alright. Maybe you just need to spend time alone. Ever thought about solo hike? Nothing big, maybe a small hike in the cool mountains at 5AM, or a small walk in an isolated area. I usually do that when I feel lost or sick of everything and feel like nothing is worth it anymore. If I don't find a solution, I just get enough motivation to carry on. A little break may  help you feel better. A day without thinking about anything, be it be projects or school or existence of life.","I think the worst thing that came with freelancing is the lack of sleep. I mostly worked with US based clients so I had to atleast be partially available during their day time. It meant sleeping at 4-5am every day. Now that I've stopped freelancing, I still cant fix my sleep no matter what. Even if I sleep early (which is almost next to impossible) I end up waking up at 3AM and cant fall back to sleep again.\n\nFreelancing took a big toll on my social life as well. I was for most part working alone. I was having to constantly reject invitations to parties and get togethers because of my work timings. I ended up losing most of my friends. Other friends left India for further studies and lost touch. \n\nNow I have quit freelancing, but I'm having imposter syndrome and losing my confidence with each passing day.","Sem bro...all these models, fitness freaks, influencers","Umm, don't use Instagram. I only use Telegram and WhatsApp.","That's not moving out? Moving out means being financially independent. Did you pay for college yourself?","Hookers...I still think of good times to stimulate me every two hours. I can never get women like that for free because they were way out of my league. \n\nThe best hooker I had were the ones I did Molly with. Imagine you just hit puberty and the prettiest girl in class fell in love with you, that's what it felt like. Was a big thing for me because I've only faced rejections. \n\nHookers on molly genuinely feel connected to you instead of the money like many others. There's a reason why drug dealers have harems.\n\nIn retrospect I should have spent more money to them over education food and other useless shit. \n\nOnly thing in life I'm curious about anymore is more drugs. I don't know how to source them in India and I can't go back to the first world anymore.","Try a lot in Random discussion thread. But can't sustain a conversation.","Guys can be emotionally intelligent too. I've learnt a lot from some men. Speak for yourself (and myself :P) but not in general","I do solo walks a lot nowdays. And by I love rants, I meant I love listening to them. So, you can PM me.","Well, r/instagramreality is for you.","Moving out doesn't have to mean being financially independent.\n\nAnd no they paid for my college. It's government polytechnic with 3k/year fee though","Molly with Hookers! Man, that's quite something. \n\n\u003e In retrospect I should have spent more money to them over education food and other useless shit.\n\nDidn't your education enable to experience the best moments of your life (your time with hookers) in the first place? Would you have been able to do it without getting a decent education and then a job to earn money to spend on these first world luxuries? \n\nDrugs would worsen situation and cause your downward spiral. I would suggest you be cautious of their overuse.","So what hope do you have for your future? Will you get married? Can you live to old age on your parents' money? To me it sounds like you are in extreme depression. Have you seen a psychiatrist regarding this? Maybe you should try r/nofap or join a group of tantrics to initiate you in the Indian version of what you liked to do.","It's generally easier to sustain conversation through voice calls. You can try that here or on Indian discord channels. You can dm me as well if you would like.","Oh well, I just posted my whole rant. On the other hand, I have a lot to rant about every day. So tomorrow, I might just have a rant and I'll surely make you listen whether you want it or not.","Real smooth blackfyre *subtle_smirk.png*","Why? All the people going to college are moving out ? School kids in boarding school are moving out? The only place they can still call home is home. \n\nPeople in western countries move out at 18 years old because the parents legally need not provide for an adult. And the 18 year old has to fend for themselves. As long as you are dependent you cant truly said you moved out. As the person above asked you how did you do this?

It's called [CarouselRecyclerView](https://github.com/Datron/CarouselRecyclerView). I'm looking for any kind of feedback on it.","Are there any job opportunities for Controls engineers in India? I am thinking of pursuing ECE (currently in 12th) and I have interest in Control System design.

Try to make it classify news based on the subjects.","Where are you sourcing your news from?","How are you funding it??\n\nAnd secondly it would be great to have categories or to extract news article from a single source eg. The Hindu website.","I loved it ..cool.","Which web framework have you used ?","Unless it‚Äôs coursework help I wouldn‚Äôt put too much time into it. It‚Äôs going to be irrelevant very quickly with the advent of neural networks. It may sound like a glib comment, but that‚Äôs what is happening. Speech processing is the only field that still relies on old school DSP to some extent.","Gonzalez is great for image processing and Richard Szeliski‚Äôs book is gold standard in computer vision. You could start watching the introductory computer vision course at Udacity or enroll free in the Image Processing course by Duke at Coursera. \n\nI also would suggest learning linear algebra and probability + statistics ( Bayesian approach, stochastic processes, etc ).","I'm assuming you mean penetration testing by \"hacking\"\nI'll also assume that you're competent using google and have Kali setup as a VM or dual-boot. If you don't I'd first suggest that you get a good knowledge of basic bash commands in linux.\n\nNow, Go to canyouhack.us and try to complete the challenges, if that's too hard or you don't know where to start I'd suggest overthewire.com which has some pretty good challenges.\n\nCheck out /r/netsecstudents which has plenty of guides to help you get started.\n\nCheck out cybrary.it and hackthebox.eu as well. \n\nCybrary has tons of courses mostly free relating to cyber security and hackthebox is like canyouhack.us but harder and better in every way.\n\nAlso, DON'T get CEH/ECSA/LPT unless you absolutely NEED it for a job. The certificates are nothing but a piece of paper which teach you rudimentary stuff that you would have already learnt by doing stuff.\n\n OSCP followed by GIAC or SANS is the way to go.\n\nBest of luck in your journey.","I am not from CSE and I started preparing late.\n\nJune 1 tbh.","I agree.

Also he said without certificates companies don't even like to give chance.\n\nIs there any couching centre for OSCP or I have learn myself from all this websites and then give exam?\n\nAlso if you don't mind, are you working in cybersecurity field?","Is load balancer a component in the python app you developed ? Curious about how it handles heavy traffic. I have developed a Nodejs app that runs extremely slowly even under moderate load.","Yeah image processing is going to be outdated by the time you are ready to participate in job market meaningfully if you don‚Äôt know it already.","No, I doubt if there's a load balancer. The site loads around 30KB of requests ( much less when cached ), so it is lightweight. If your node js app is running slowly, try analyzing the speed of each component in network tab ( in developer options ).

As long as people are being social at work and helping each other out and there's general commaradarie and teamwork in the office no one should be marginalised for not hanging outside work. Not just women, what about introverts in general who want to keep to themselves after work?\n\nAlso, it isn't like women don't bakkofy gaalis. What shit. And why should the presence of the fairer sex stop you from speaking your mind?\n\nIf the men are friends from before or happened to build relationships that are beyond that of coworkers I'd give them a pass. But if it's clearly coworker relationship and plans are being made to include all men in the team but women are explicitly not invited then it's just shitty attitude. Invite everyone. Except your boss. Go to town bitching about everyone else. Be friends irrespective of sex. That's how teams are built and stay together.","Invite yourself once?

It also features Snapdragon 855 but its Asus. I don't know much about the hardware quality of Asus.\n\nI have been using OnePlus though from Oneplus 2 , and it always delivers. \n\nWait for Poco F2 then. Lets see what the competition offers. Then decide. \nRight now, I don't think any phone ( with the same price tag or lesser price ) competes 7 pro. \nS10e is higher priced. Pixel 3A is like a noob in front of 7 pro, though, you may go for it as Pixels are quite good too, but I don't think they are value for money. \n\n7Pro is not quite value for money either, but the 7 really is.","\u003eHow's the SOT?\n\nI'm using it in Bengaluru, with Jio and airtel (Jio on VoLTE, airtel on regular). You can use dual VoLTE as well, but I don't call from my airtel sim.\n\nI just got it yesterday. Set it to auto resolution(switches between 1080p and 1440p depending on content) and 90Hz. Currently at 44% and 5 hours 40 minutes SoT (watched youtube on speaker for about 1.5 hours, reddit for 2 hours, camera for 30 min. Rest browser, social media and regular stuff). I think the battery life is pretty great, and I'm expecting 8-9 hours SoT at least. My previous phone(OnePlus 3T) had about half the battery life this has.\n\n\u003eI bet the performance must be really really good obviously. How's the 90Hz display?\n\nThe performance is epic. OnePlus phones are generally very smooth and fast, but the 90Hz refresh takes it to another level. This phone samples your touch at 135Hz, so it's very responsive too. You have to see it to believe it, honestly. Everything feels like buttery smooth, and it's a real value add-on to me. I don't think I'm going to buy any phone with 60Hz screen.\n\n\u003eAlso, I read a report about \"ghost touches\" and they sent an update to fix that, any problems with that?\n\nFortunately no. They haven't fixed it yet AFAIK. Apparently turning off NFC fixes it temporarily, but I guess they'll send an update soon enough. NFC is pretty useless in India anyway (QR code jindabad).\n\nOverall, my experience is overwhelmingly positive. The camera is the only area where I feel it misses, but even that should be fixed with updates(or gcam) soon enough.","Too hot weather to have it","Give me the details.","Oh I thought it was first time.

Maybe bank offers etc.","Done!","It was your first date with this girl?","What you say is partly true. Guys can be non-inclusive at times for whatever reasons. But not just due to the fact that you are a girl, more because not many men are much open with girls, or don't have/never had close relationship with girls to let them know they are similar to us. And not being present at such times does hamper growth due to lack of 'happy hours' together as a team.\n\nThat said, only you can challenge this status quo. Once you start going with the team to such parties, everyone gets comfortable to the idea of inviting you from next time on.","Lol the way you said it, it made me chuckle.

I have never done solo travel. Add to that my shy self I'm positively scared I would not make friends or find people to hang with on my solo travels\n2. I don't know what I want to see in Europe \n3. I am in a rut and not much excites me\n\nHere's what gets me a little up beat (but very remotely) - \n\n1. Possibility of doing videshi drugs (probably in Amsterdam). But knowing how difficult it is to  score and how easy it is to get scammed this doesn't look like a possibility.

It also doesn't necessarily mean that we shouldn't call them out for their behavior and they certainly aren't infallible, for they are humans just like the rest of us and thus, are susceptible to errors and mistakes.\n\nThen again, I guess that it must've been a sort of dark humor from his side and thus, I might have taken that meme a bit seriously. \n\nBut, the person in question is a complete momma's boy (and is very attached and sentimental with both of his parents, really) afaik and thus, I have a feeling that he posted that meme un-ironically as a status.","[deleted]","Is there anyone in London?

I can't tell my parents about her and I love with them. \n\nI am getting utterly depressed about it. I have a feeling I am losing love of my life.

There are also free walks happening all the time (not really free though, they'll ask you for a donation at the end which is typically 2-10 bucks but totally worth it). I even got laid once because of one those walks. Used to go every weekend I was there.\n\nBut the best part about Amsterdam for me is the club culture and metropolitan crowd. I met with people from countries I hadn't even heard of. Rembrandtplein is just stuff of dreams. If not anything, you could hangout by the strip clubs. Entry in la vie en roost is just 5 bucks and the girls are good. There's a ton of other stuff too including the museum's and the absolutely amazing countryside. Amsterdam is amazing. Just go man.","Switzerland is soo fucking beautiful that you'll just stare at natural beauty alk day and never be bored it.","I guess I'm somewhat qualified to answer this.

Now it isn't an option as the toll it would take on my parents would be too much to handle for them.

She is the kind of person who will face bad feelings just to make me feel good. Never will say something that would hurt me. \n\nI can just be with her man. as you said.

I went and kept on iterating I wanted to complain. They did not let him come in-front of me and kept telling me to just give him a notice / police level restraining. they probably told him the same that he was better off me and the harassment complaint I was going to do.

Eventually, they were a mess and full of dandruff. With the alarming amount of hair falling coupled with the fear of going bald - I went for a hair spa. \n\nHere are the pointers which worked for me: \n\n1) Be very, very picky with your shampoo. Pick the one which you hair requires - consult a doctor or a good saloon for this information. They have enough experience and will tell you good shampoos. Also, pick out a conditioner the same way. Once you have done that, use it as per the directions. \n\n2) Now that you have chosen your shampoo + conditioner, don't go over board with its use. Shampoos drain your scalp of all the natural oils and minerals which is not good for the health of your hair. You might have to use it a bit more often initially, but once your hair are in good shape, bring it down to once a week or twice a week. NEVER USE SOAP TO WASH YOUR HAIR.\n\n3) Oiling - oiling is not necessarily required. I only oil the night before I plan to shampoo my hair. A good hair massage with almond oil and wash it all off the next day. \n\nIf your hair is already in a bad state or you have dandruff, it won't hurt to go get a hair spa. You might even need 3-4 sittings to get them to a level where they can be managed by a normal shampoo + conditioner routine. Spend some money, your hair are worth it and they would affect your confidence if life way too much.","Hairloss happens from the maternal side, not from the paternal.

Buy from the hot food bar of the two major grocery stores \"Coop\" and \"Migros\". They are usually 1/3rd of the price of eating in restaurants. \n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nPublic transportation is phenomenal in Switzerland, They will take you almost anywhere, so stay in places outside of major hubs like Interlaken \u0026 Zurich. There is significant difference in hotel prices outside of major tourist places.\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nLook into getting a travel pass, there are two kinds, one of which you only pay half fare for any train, bus or boat journeys and another which you pay nothing other than the cost of travel pass.","Switzerland, I took a rental car from geneva to zurich and back exploring little villages and towns along the way. You can also drive through the alpine passes(furka pass being a good one) during this time of the year.","3 guys? Bachelors? Apply for a visa before you make any bookings at all. \n\nBack in 2016, we planned a 2 weeks visit. The four of us, me, my wife and 2 of my bachelor friends, applied for Schnegen visa together. My wife and I got the visa, my friends didn't. Got rejected upon reapplication too. Both have a stable job, family ties to India, the documentation was complete, but they just didn't get the visa.","If you're not really into partying and love road trips you can try Iceland. It's really beautiful and you might get to see Northern lights.","On a side note, is a 1.5 lakh Europe trip possible if I stay at hostels and stuff?","I feel European countries can be sorted by 'gotta see' rating. If you go to Europe and return seeing Lucerne - you sort of have not really experienced Europe per se.\n\n1. Italy - Rome + Vatican city\n2. France - Paris\n3. Turkey - Istanbul\n4. UK - London\n5. Spain - Barcelona\n6. Netherlands - Amsterdam\n7. ....\n8. ....\n\n.....Switzerland - Beautiful alps.. and that is sorta where it ends. (Xenophobic Swiss)\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nI strongly recommend the top two.  2 days in Paris + 3 days in Rome.\n\nGo to Paris, enjoy the Eiffel tower, the sandwiches, walk along seine, walk on the Champs-Elysees, the Louvre...\n\nEarly morning flight to Rome ($50)\n\nMarvel at the chaotic traffic, the old historic architecture mixed with modern malls, the colosseum, the Trevi fountain, real gelato, pizza, sandwiches, Italians who wave their hands all over... the outdoor cafes in the evening, the squares with musicians.. and of course a guided tour of the Vatican ...","Postpone the trip to October, go to Germany, attend the Oktoberfest, then head to Amsterdam.","italia","Oktoberfest in Munich starts late September. If you do that, Austria and Czech republic are pretty close. And Bavarian Alps is breathtakingly beautiful.","This really depends a lot on your interests and budget, but my personal recommendation, if you're interested in food and countryside living, I highly recommend Italy. Spend one day in Rome to see some of the usual tourist sites, and then head to the countryside.  \n\nIs it the most famous and most prettiest part of Europe? Probably not (but its still damn pretty). But it sounds like what you're looking for.","I'd recommend the Basque Country (Pais Vasco). It's often overlooked by non-European tourists - indeed, you won't find the usual Chinese or American tour group plodding around as you will in the likes of Madrid, Barcelona, Lisboa, Marseille, Roma, Firenze, Munchen etc.\n\nI'm just back from 3.5 days cycling in the region: Biarritz - Hendaye - Donostia - Amorebieta - Gernika - Bermeo - Bilbao - Llodio - Vitoria-Gasteiz - Durango.\n\nThe whole area is great for mountain biking and road cycling - lots of hills and some descent col-type descents - particularly just north of Bilbao and south of Durango. The coast from Hendaye down to Donostia hosts a decent number of surfing competitions. The sunset over San Jan de Gaztelugatze is fairly unbeatable too. Regards food, Donostia (also known as \"San Sebastian\") has the *highest* number of Michelin-starred restaurants per capita of any city on the planet (16 at present) - a great mix of seafood as well as produce from the interior. Snacks such as pintxos and txapoli are worth a try in the early evening. Nightlife often continues deep into the early morning (3am+). You'll also notice there's a real hybrid of cultures - Basque mixed with French and Spanish influences. Street signs are often bi- (if not trilingual) and there's a decent number of art museums across the region too (the most famous being the Guggenheim and Bellas Artes in Bilbao). Once you go out of the main towns you'll often see many signs advocating for independence for Euskara (the Basque region). If you're cycling it's also relatively easy to stick your bike on the trains (Euskotren, Cercanias, TER, though possibly you might need a reservation with Renfe). I stayed in some top-quality Airbnbs (5\\* superhosts) and spent less than ‚Ç¨85 all-in for 3 nights in 3 separate cities (Anglet, Bilbao, Vitoria-Gasteiz), and this is pretty close to peak-season.\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nRegards some of the other suggestions on the thread: Amsterdam (having lived there) is a *massive* tourist trap (in the \"grachtengordel\" - i.e. the canal region). The accommodation is massively overpriced. The only Airbnbs are quite a way out from the centre. The quality of food and drink outside supermarkets is very poor given what you are being charged. The place attracts some of the most clueless tourists from outside Europe - really, if they want drugs and hookers there are plenty of other cities which offer similar and much more affordable prices - just that those tourists generally haven't heard of them. Dutch cuisine is considered some of the most unappetizing food on the continent - take a random city in say, Finland and then compare the number of clients a Greek restaurant receives compared to say a Dutch one, and you'll see my point. And as for the landscape - it's pretty flat and boring, since much of the land has been reclaimed from the sea (in the case of Flevoland, barely a century ago). Switzerland is a bit more interesting as a quadrilingual country, particularly with regards to the landscape - but again, it's massively overpriced and you might as well head over to the Dolomiti (Italian Alps), Julianski (Slovenian Alps) or even Franche-Comte for better value.","I would not recommend going to Europe. Why spend your money in a place that is increasingly nationalistic and racist. Keep it in Asia.","I'd not recommend Switzerland. It's beautiful, no doubt but its just too expensive to really enjoy it unless you are loaded with money.\n\nA decent, livable hostel would be 50-70 euros/night and any decent food that isn't a fast food chain like McDonalds will set you back 20 euros/meal (make that 30-40 euros/meal if you want a few beers to go with it).\n\nIMHO, one should go to Slovenia instead of Switzerland. Its the same scenery \u0026 mind blowing beautiful mountains at 1/10th the cost (Slovenia borders Switzerland).\n\nAmsterdam is perfect. Can do 2 nights in Amsterdam, party \u0026 explore this fascinating ultraliberal oasis \u0026 then chill for 2 nights in Rotterdam and enjoy exploring the city on bicycle (cycling in Amsterdam is just too stressful) and then finally head back for one final night of partying in Amsterdam.\n\nSt Christophers is a great hostel in Amsterdam (its a party hostel so don't count on sleep, if you want sleep go for Ecomama/Cocomama) and Hostel ROOM is a great hostel in Rotterdam (much more chill but has a 24/7 bar).","Which were the other places you visited? How about East Europe, Turkey etc","I love the City of Switzerland!","Abey, swiss ‚Äúcity‚Äù kab se ho gaya bhai...","Avoid the whole of Italy?!","When I stayed in Zurich, free breakfast consisted of bread and a eggs that one had to boil yourself in an electric boiler. So, I'm a bit wary of that in Switzerland atleast.","Your friends had good travel history? I think it matters. However correct me if I m wrong,  you can't apply without the itinerary and booking details","Costly too","\"you might get to see Northern lights.\"\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nNot in August or September.","Excluding airfare, yes.

If PayTM is benefiting from this, so do the other companies like Amazon, Google, PhonePe etc. A domestic transaction system also prevent the foreign interference, especially when the trade wars will increase in the future.

I won't entertain this in it's entirety on account of the track record of Indians being behind schedule in every project they take up; be it defence projects like the Tejas LCA or civilian infrastructure projects like smart cities and then when said projects finally come out, they tend to be lackluster in features, basically a watered down version of what they used to be during their inception.

Again, there are other alternatives, like, oh you know, legal trade and legal technology transfers.\n\nCounter to popular belief, most of the technology transfer happen legally in China. Atleast in 80s and 90s. Foreign company could only work in china by setup joint venture with domestic companies. So, they are willingly sharing technology with them. It was the price they had to pay.

The main purpose of IRNSS is to just work when the other system will go down.\n\nNope. In this case, they have to rely on mobile phone manufacturers to get the tech into common man's hands. Regardless of what ISRO's track records may be, this one is not depending entirely on them. Sorry bud, but this particular factor is influenced by people other than ISRO. Not much can be done about that.\n\n\u003e US is a bully. Do you wanna be a bully?\n\nNo? Did I not say that Trump is an idiot for instigating trade wars?\n\n\u003e  Russia forced companies to support GLONASS if they want to sell phones in Russia. And well they did. Now GLONASS is supported by every major phone company. No one shuned Russia for that.\n\nThe \"shunning\" part was not meant as a direct consequence of them forcing everyone to sell GLONASS compatible phones, but as their collective attitude towards other countries when it comes to trade and diplomatic relations.\n\n\u003e Counter to popular belief, most of the technology transfer happen legally in China. Atleast in 80s and 90s. Foreign company could only work in china by setup joint venture with domestic companies. So, they are willingly sharing technology with them. It was the price they had to pay.

The only reason they haven't been shut out by every major country from their trade relations dossier is because they are the manufacturing hub of the world. So when they pull shit like this, most countries prefer to just bend over and take it because you can't really sideline China when it comes to manufacturing goods; they're the indisputable leaders.\n\n\u003e 4 Dassault Rafale cost more than that.\n\nYour point? That Rafales are more costly than to develop tech at home? Well, I got news for ya- that ain't the same thing. Navigation tech is not defense tech. If you want to compare, allow me to turn your argument on it's head: Presenting- Tejas LCA. Stuck in the R\u0026D labs for the last three decades and has costed a total of $2.5bn USD to taxpayers like you and me up until now with no real possibility of being inducted in the Air Force scot-free anywhere in sight.\n\n\u003e This is your words. \"everyone would do well to remember that we benefit more from keeping our gates open for business\". From my understanding, you said everyone will get benefit from globalization.\n\nI said \"everyone would do well to remember\". Even I'm not that dumb to generalize everyone and claim that everyone favors globalization and everyone will reap it's benefits.\n\n\u003e But this not the case, some countries do lose more than they gain, if they give full open access of their market to foreign companies.

Did I not say that Trump is an idiot for instigating trade wars?\n\nUS has been seen as a bully throughout the cold war. Trump only solidify this image even more now.\n\n\u003e You're so misinformed, it's not even funny anymore.\n\nOh man. I specifically mentioned 80s and 90s, Because that time China was not that powerful. They needed the help of other countries to build products in their country. They didn't forced foreign companies to open factories there. They did it themselves and the essential requirement was the join ventures. hence, legal technology transfer. Only when China become manufacturing hub, they become confident enough to have state sponsored tech stealing, which other countries did too in the past.\n\n\u003e they're the indisputable leaders.\n\nIn the end, it worked for China. What the hell are you arguing about? The policy which are you arguing against is what made China the 2nd powerful nation.\n\n\u003e Your point?\n\nMy point is cost of IRNSS is peanut compare to India spend billions on other projects or purchase.\n\n\u003e Navigation tech is not defense tech.\n\nYou are weak in history. This IRNSS project only started because US deny India the access of military-grade GPS (which is more accurate than the civilian one) during the Kargil war in 1999. That's when India realised that they can't rely on US and needed to create their own navigation system.\n\n\u003e Even I'm not that dumb to generalize everyone and claim that everyone favors globalization and everyone will reap it's benefits.\n\nStill you make it sound like \"globalisation will only benifit more\". When it doesn't benefit, then it's up to the country to decide how they wanna deal with globalization. \n\n\u003e This argument is entirely invalid, from head to toe.\n\nYou completely ignored that fact that NCPI still have to write the software and develop the product. They still have to follow the software and product development process. They don't have unlimited supply of money. They also have to think about the budget. Also, even VISA and Mastercard follow the process. They evolved with time. They still have to fix and sort the problems in the system. They don't just done with it by saying \"okay, VISA and Mastercard are good enough now, let's shutdown the development\". \n\n\u003e ?\n\nIn current banking system, you are constrained by the rules of banks and countries. So, bitcoin will give you ultimate freedom to do **what you want with your money**. /s\n\n\u003e This was done under a well thoughout scheme and this whole thing's bigger than the CEO of a single bank.\n\nOh yeah. Banks are regulated. Well then it's up to RBI to decide or whoever in charge. Well you should compaint with them if their policy of saving transaction charges and self-sufficiency hurts your feelings.\n\n\u003e your experience still does not negate or falsify mine and people like me who go through this pain everyday.\n\nBad bank service is not related to RuPay being bad. Even before this, bank services used to be shit. From my experience from late 2000s and early 2010s, sometimes they used to send card late or sometimes even lost (happened to my father), sometimes card won't work in ATM. But I never said that **VISA is shit**. Because I'm tech savy enough to know the difference between banks, ATMs and transaction processor (in this case, VISA).\n\n**tl;dr** You are barking at the wrong door. Go and shit on your Bank or RBI. RuPay works as it meant to be.","\u003e Lol. It's like saying backup for \"worst case scenario\" is not a valid reason for \"saving money\" or having a life insurance.\n\nI see a pattern throughout your post history. When confronted with rationalism, you tend to take the opposition's arguments and over-simplify them to prove your point instead of presenting facts to make your case stronger.\n\n\u003e And I already told you how Russia solved that problem.\n\nBrute force tactics ‚â† solution.\n\nYou don't break your door everytime you come home. You use a key instead. It's a one time investment, causes a lotta effort to be put into but saves you time and energy forever after that which would otherwise be invested into tearing a whole goddamn door down and then making  a new one everytime you enter/exit the house.\n\nForcing manufacturers to adapt to this tech has resulted in Russia forcing a 25% import duty  on all GPS-capable devices, including mobile phones, unless they are compatible with GLONASS. That hurt their trade relations. That's what I meant when I said \"Russia is an asshole\". Don't be an asshole. No one wants to do business with an asshole. That's how you start trade-wars which end up hurting everybody, which is what I meant when I said globalization is what everyone should be embracing instead of fighting each-other via these unnecessarily imposed duties. Their user segment implementation for GLONASS has been lacking so everyone else must suffer for it. Develop a tech good enough so that people be lining up to your door for it. India and Russia can learn a thing or two about that from the US, no matter how much you or they hate the US; this something they got right and are better at doing than both the Russians and the Indians. Same thing with RuPay. I would be more than happy to adapt to it if it was half as competent, at least in the international transactions department, as VISA and Mastercard. I already made it clear when I said, \"Don't get me wrong, I'm all for contingency plans. But half-assed contingency plans? I'd take foreign services over those, thank you. Don't presume to force something on me when you clearly haven't put considerable effort behind it. It's my money, I'll do what I want.\".\n\n\u003e Also this not a new tech which phone companies have to reinvent. They'll just need to add IRNSS supported frequency in the GPS (or navigation) chip. India is a major market, no companies will leave India just for this small issue.\n\nOh? I wonder why they're not already compatible yet then? Because you definitely make it sound like a piece of cake, bud. lol.\n\n\u003e US has been seen as a bully throughout the cold war. Trump only solidify this image even more now.\n\nThis is such a blanket statement, apart from being highly subjective and objectively incorrect that I don't even know where to begin refuting this. They are bullies, yes. But we're discussing the trade-wars aspect here, specifically. They've never been this aggressive, as they're right now under Trump, ever before in my knowledge. When it comes to diplomatic relations? Yes, they've been a bully throughout but this discussion is not about that.\n\n\u003e Oh man. I specifically mentioned 80s and 90s, Because that time China was not that powerful. They needed the help of other countries to build products in their country. They didn't forced foreign companies to open factories there. They did it themselves and the essential requirement was the join ventures. hence, legal technology transfer. Only when China become manufacturing hub, they become confident enough to have state sponsored tech stealing, which other countries did too in the past.\n\nLOL what? So you're pulling facts that were relevant in 80s and 90s and using them to justify your concerns for trade-wars happening in 2019 because you had nothing left? Dude, shove off, will ya? I already showed you how rampant Chinese theft is. Don't bother replying unless you have a substantial evidence proving ALL of those reports wrong. Because you stand incorrect as it is. China **IS** a thief and a bigger bully than the US across **ALL** fronts and your arguments from the 80s and 90s are not permissible. Not in this discussion about the 2019 Trade Wars, anyways.\n\n\u003e In the end, it worked for China. What the hell are you arguing about? The policy which are you arguing against is what made China the 2nd powerful nation.\n\nAgain with the 80s and 90s thing? They are what they are. You keep giving arguments for WHY things are the way they are instead of admitting the fact that the Chinese don't do as much legal trade and technology transfer as you've been making them out to be throughout this whole discussion. The fact is, they keep hitting Governments across the world with small scale cyber assaults to accomplish that without giving something in return i.e. **illegally**.\n\n\u003e My point is cost of IRNSS is peanut compare to India spend billions on other projects or purchase.\n\nA $325 million USD worth peanut, to clarify. I'm not surprised you can't even begin to realize how much that money is. None of us here would see that much money in our entire lives so its understandable we just mention these figures casually and treat it like it's nothing. Not your fault.\n\n\u003e You are weak in history.\n\nFor pointing out that Navigation tech is different from Defense tech? LMAO.\n\n\u003e This IRNSS project only started because US deny India the access of military-grade GPS (which is more accurate than the civilian one) during the Kargil war in 1999. That's when India realised that they can't rely on US and needed to create their own navigation system.\n\nAnd how does that prove that my point about GPS and fighter jets are two very different kinds of technology? Matlab kuch bhi?\n\n\u003e Still you make it sound like \"globalisation will only benifit more\". When it doesn't benefit, then it's up to the country to decide how they wanna deal with globalization. \n\nI didn't \"make it sound\" like anything. If you want to misinterpret what I said on purpose, that's your problem, not mine.\n\n\u003e You completely ignored that fact that NCPI still have to write the software and develop the product. They still have to follow the software and product development process. They don't have unlimited supply of money.\n\nThey have more than most. Mastercard and Visa started out with even lesser. Your argument still doesn't convince me that the Government of India and NCPI are little more than startups. Don't shift the goalposts now. Stick to your startup argument. You're not allowed to backtrack on your words when you're confronted with logic.\n\n\u003e In current banking system, you are constrained by the rules of banks and countries. So, bitcoin will give you ultimate freedom to do what you want with your money. /s\n\nKeep this unsolicited, sarcastic piece of advice to yourself. I never asked for it.\n\n\u003e Oh yeah. Banks are regulated. Well then it's up to RBI to decide or whoever in charge. Well you should compaint with them if their policy of saving transaction charges and self-sufficiency hurts your feelings.\n\nYou're so naive.\n\n\u003e Bad bank service is not related to RuPay being bad.\n\nIt's not. That's what the rest of our discussion is about. This is an additional problem **resulting** from the introduction of an inferior service. I never had to deal with this shit when RuPay didn't exist. THAT is the point here, not the incompetence of the banks. I know they've always been incompetent. That's not the issue.\n\n\u003e tl;dr You are barking at the wrong door. Go and shit on your Bank or RBI. RuPay works as it meant to be.\n\nIt is clear that I cannot make you see the other side of this coin (no pun intended). Have a nice day.","\u003e  When confronted with rationalism, you tend to take the opposition's arguments and over-simplify them to prove your point instead of presenting facts to make your case stronger.\n\nIt's called an \"analogy\". I simplify, so that people like you can understand. Okay, tell me why for a nation, having a backup plan is not a valid reason for a \"worst case scenerio\" but it's a valid reason for a human?\n\n\u003e I meant when I said \"Russia is an asshole\". Don't be an asshole.\n\nYou are an idiot. Every country use import duty as a tactic to force companies to comply with their rules or to protect their industries. India do that always. Even America apply import duty on agricultural products to protect their industries or to make companies comply with their requirement. If you say that act make a country an asshole then almost every country on this planet is an asshole.\n\n\u003e so everyone else must suffer for it.\n\nOnly intially, for a while. Apple is supporting GLONASS since iPhone 4s (2011, the same year Russia implemeted that rule). So essentially everyone in the world who have iPhone can use GLONASS even if they brought iPhone outside Russia. Btw when the device use both GPS and GLONASS at the same time, you get more accurancy because you have more satellites for the reference point. Using both make your device better than just using GPS only.\n\n\u003e Don't get me wrong, I'm all for contingency plans. But half-assed contingency plans? I'd take foreign services over those, thank you.\n\nYou are just saying don't create new products, don't do any development, don't be self-sufficient, because foreign companies can do better job than the domestic one. It sound like you are in favor of colonialism.\n\n\u003e Don't presume to force something on me when you clearly haven't put considerable effort behind it. It's my money, I'll do what I want.\n\nAh. then create a separate country for yourself, because there's always someone else (read: govt) who'll decide for you. but still there'll be some choice.\n\n\u003e I wonder why they're not already compatible yet then? Because you definitely make it sound like a piece of cake, bud.\n\nBecause your devices need the chip which support those frequency. In 2G era, some phones didn't used to get signal when you travel to certain countries, because those phones didn't have supported chip. Now every phone manufacture have a chip which support frequency of every telcos in the world. Just like that they need to implement a new chip which also support IRNSS. Also it's takes time to test a new system. GLONASS was in development since 80s, compare to IRNSS which started in early 2010s.\n\n\u003e  they've been a bully throughout but this discussion is not about that.\n\nAre you kidding me? When I said bully I didn't meant just trade war which trump started. Current trade war is a result of long history. You can't just comment about the trade war without having a context. Trade war is all about who can bully more. You agree that they were bully, now they are bullying even more. \n\n\u003e you're pulling facts that were relevant in 80s and 90s and using them to justify your concerns for trade-wars happening in 2019 because you had nothing left?\n\nThis was the respose to that statement when you said china stole every tech. So, I'm telling you how technology transfer happened **legally** in 80s and 90s. You need to know the history to know the context. You should compare China stealing tech to US stealing tech in the past. China **IS** a thief and US **WAS** a thief. This is relevent in 2019  trade war because stealing is common between both nations.\n\n\u003e  they keep hitting Governments across the world with small scale cyber assaults to accomplish that without giving something in return\n\nChina is not the only country who do cyber assaults.\n\n\u003e A $325 million USD worth peanut, to clarify. I'm not surprised you can't even begin to realize how much that money is. \n\nFor single human, this figure is huge, but not for a 1B+ nation. $325 million is for a project which will atleast work for 20 years (estimating based on the life span of GPS satellites), which comes under $20 million **a year**. Compare this to Billions India spend on defense projects and purchases **every year**.\n\n\u003e For pointing out that Navigation tech is different from Defense tech? \n\nBecause I'm surprised that you are talking about the IRNSS and don't know the connection with the defense or kargil war. Anyway, let me prove it to you how navigation tech is **NOT** different to defense tech. Okay, go and check the wikipedia of GPS and IRNSS. In both pages it mention the \"type\" as **Military** and civilian/commercial. And here it mention that [GPS satellite constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_satellite_blocks) is operated by US air force, not even NASA. Why would they do that if it's not a defense project? And as far as I know in both US and India funding for navigation system comes more from defense budget than the space budget.\n\n\u003e how does that prove that my point about GPS and fighter jets are two very different kinds of technology?\n\nBecause both are related to defense.\n\n\u003e If you want to misinterpret what I said on purpose, that's your problem, not mine.\n\nI don't wanna go into the terminology thing. but from my understanding, your idea of globalisation is similar to western perspective than mine with the asian one.\n\n\u003e Mastercard and Visa started out with even lesser.\n\nDude, Those were started and owned by the banks, they were never started as a small company. It's the same with NCPI which owned by Indian banks. Govt. only dictate the policy, they don't give free money to NCPI, banks do.\n\n\u003e You're so naive.\n\nand you're your flair.\n\n\u003e THAT is the point here, not the incompetence of the banks. I know they've always been incompetent.\n\nIssuing 3 same cards back to back is service issue or system failure/bug. RuPay doesn't issue a card to you, Banks do. You can only find a fault after recieving a card and using it. Unless you are doing international transaction or going abroad, RuPay card works fine.\n\nWhen I was in college, I needed to buy domains and web hosting, but my SBI VISA card never worked. Then somehow I enabled international transaction, still It didn't worked. Then I googled and find out that the default VISA card they give is so shitty that it won't work in international sites. Then I went to the branch and specifically asked for \"SBI YUVA card\" enabled with international transaction. SBI officials had even less clue about that specific card. I even talked to the manager and had to explain about the PayPal. Finally, I got the card and worked for my purpose. Still It used to fail in some websites (especially american ones) if they didn't enable [3-D secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure) in their websites.\n\nI'm just saying that even with VISA my experience was not always good. Sometimes it was bank's fault or sometimes merchant's. In your case, it's banks fault. Not RuPay. Change your bank and get a VISA card. simple.\n\n\u003e It is clear that I cannot make you see the other side of this coin\n\nI can say the same thing about you. :)","**GPS satellite blocks**\n\nA GPS satellite is a satellite used by the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS). The first satellite in the system, Navstar 1, was launched February 22, 1978. The GPS satellite constellation is operated by the 50th Space Wing of the United States Air Force.\n\nThe GPS satellites circle the Earth at an altitude of about 20,000 km (12,427 miles) and complete two full orbits every day.\n\n***\n\n**3-D Secure**\n\n3-D Secure is an XML-based protocol designed to be an additional security layer for online credit and debit card transactions. It was originally developed by Arcot Systems (now CA Technologies) and first deployed by Visa with the intention of improving the security of Internet payments and is offered to customers under the name Visa Secure (formerly known as Verified by Visa). Services based on the protocol have also been adopted by Mastercard as Mastercard SecureCode, and by JCB International as J/Secure. American Express added 3-D Secure in selected markets on November 8, 2010 as American Express SafeKey, and continues to launch additional markets.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot\u0026message=Excludeme\u0026subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","So the fangs finally come out.

You yourself diverted from the topic. I replied according to that. I put the facts about the IRNSS, about the trade war, tech piracy and globalisation.\n\nIf you just want to stick to the topic, which is RuPay. Then I should remind you. [EU started TIPS to break the dominance of VISA and Mastercard in europe](https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/tips-challenging-visa-and-mastercard/). They also recently fined Mastercard $648 million in anti-trust case where they find out that Mastercard **artificially** raising the cost of payment/transaction fees which hurts consumers. Now think, if even EU have reasons to not trust duopoly of VISA and Mastercard. Then heck, India have a lot of reasons to not trust them and start their own transaction system, which we already have as RuPay.\n\nCase closed, I think.\n\nPS. Trade war is a reality. Even if India not facing tarrifs as much as China, US is trying to arm-twist India for buying S-400 missile system from Russia. They say we can't buy just because they say so (such a bully).

So let's be glad that what we're getting is an attempt to make it as close to the US one.\n\nBecause for the guys who do know about the Indian television scene, I'm sure it's a welcome change. \n\nLet's just wish if in the subsequent seasons, if there will be, the producers are able to do justice to the show.\n\nAnd be happy for the people who are unaware of the original shows, and are watching this show for the first time.\n\nBecause for them it may turn out to be an experience they'll cherish life long, like the one we had with the US one.\nBecause I know I did.\n\nRemember, Michael Scott would like nothing more than a lot of people being happy..","This show really surprised me.

I am curious to hear what exactly is the mentality of 16% of the population of India.","\u003e  I am really curious to know what this MENTALITY everyone keeps going on about is.\n\n\nThere is no such mentality. If there was then people would have pointed it out till now. In reality, forward castes have caste supremacist mentality, but to support it they have to blame backward castes for something. \n\n\n\nIt's typical victim blaming. Few casteist people even claim that backward castes too believe \"upper caste\" are better. Honestly, if it was true the backward castes would have voted for brahmins always. If it was true, then you won't have to worry about opposition from this SC guy's family since he is marrying someone from \"upper\" caste.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, you might find dalits are less sexist than your own caste. Patriarchy comes from brahmnican system.\n\nAnd as you are marrying this guy, remember, never ever take your future kids to your extended family who are thinking like this. Lot of honor killing happens from cousins even after parents have said yes for marriage. Such people literally think dalits as subhuman. I don't want to say this, but they will think your kids too as subhuman. \n\n\nAnd one thing, do not say anything against Ambedkar ever. You can say anything else you want, you can oppose reservation, but never bring Ambedkar in that. Some people think there has been deification of Ambedkar by dalits, they might be right sometimes. Dalits will forgive you for literally everything, except criticism of Ambedkar.","Well, I don't have an answer to it. But I have heard this discrimination and 'well they are different from us, they have a different mentality' bullshit so many times. Do let me know when you have answers.\n\nKudos to your pair for looking to go forward in relationship despite being from different castes!","Fair skin = upper caste","Disclaimer: I am totally against casteism and do not consider any human indifferent on basis of cast, religion or that sort.\n\nNow, what your Grandfather is speaking about is, in the past, when there was stark differences between caste, people belonging to different caste used to have different lifestyle, from hygiene to food habits, from their education to intellectual and many more things of that sort. The way they were raised, the way they were learned to live life used to be different than one another. I hope you are getting where I am leading you to.\n\nFor example, A rich Jaamindar or wealthy Savkar or A knowledgeable Bramhin or hardworking Farmer or lower caste person, these all have different lifestyle, different upbringing, different food habits, different thought processes. So you see, The way of looking at things will be different for different caste person. \n\nAnd when you intercaste marriage, things used get mix up. Hence they (grandparents) believe intercaste marriage should be avoided.","I'm SC and what I can tell you is rather than having stereotypes, we are a very open family.. a progressive one. But there is a general fear when disclosing the caste.. Why? Cause the way your cousin judged your boyfriend.\nYour a-hole cousin. (sorry couldn't resist myself)","This post reminded me of this scene.\n\n[https://i.vgy.me/4PqG2z.jpg](https://i.vgy.me/4PqG2z.jpg)","[removed]","Aw man, that really sucks.

Exactly. \n\nAlso, thank you for but I seriously don't think there's anything brave about loving someone else from a different caste. People were dating without caring about castes in college but they were pretty clear about not marrying  SC/ST/OBC(Hypocrisy at its best,). I'd say my parents are brave for standing up for me and supporting me without paying heed to whatever the relatives say. \n\nMy sister was in DU south campus and according to her she's never really seen people being casteist( but then she's not from the castes that are discriminated against so it's hard to say. )","Ikr!? The logic is mind boggling. \n\nAs I mentioned in another comment, I am not really close to my relatives so they've never really had any sort of say in my life. They'll just judge from the sidelines. His parents seem pretty chill too but looks like his relatives could be an issue. They have this preconception that whenever anyone in their family has married outside of the caste it has lead to divorce and problems. \n\nMy dad's in the armed forces so we were moving around all the time and this is one of the reasons why I was initially pretty oblivious to the caste thing in college.I remember certain batchmates coming up to me and telling me the dude you hang out with is not from your caste etc blah blah. I was actually shocked that kids at 18 had complete knowledge of the caste and gotra thing and so many of them had looked up the caste of classmates on university website.","Lol haha, yeah.","I didn't say anything at the time because I didn't want to create a scene (I am a very short tempered person) so I just walked away.

I don't know what stupidity casteist people believe. If you know it then tell us.\n\n\n\u003e A knowledgeable Bramhin \n\n\nPeople can guess you are Brahmin just by these words. I am just pointing out obvious. \n\n\n\u003e from hygiene\n\nPure/impure in hindu religion is not about English definition of hygiene. It is about eating habits. Eating non veg makes you impure according to caste system. If it is about hygiene, then I know personally sizable people from North India don't shower everyday which is rare in South. It might be because north is cold and south is hot. But hygiene habits change by state and not by caste.","I am completely aware of it but you haven't answered my question about what are the sterotypes associated with certain castes?","Reservation is a proxy, a strawman to deify their animosity. It's something like get out of our space. It's much more insidious. And the only way to overcome it is to talk about it.

Let me guess, Brahmin used brain so they are evolved for intelligence. Khstriya used muscles so they are evolved for muscular strength.\n\n\n\nYour ignorance is huge and basic. Just read more about human evolution to remove these basic misconceptions.\n\n\n\nLatest genetic evidence says there was no caste system in India 70 generations ago or 1600 years ago. Before that there was free intermarriage. Search Google for this.\n\n\nAlso search Google for Indus valley civilization genetic evidence. It clearly shows IVC was made from 100% ancient South Indian ASI people. The closest relative to these people are tribals today. Ancient north indians ANI didn't have anything to do with IVC. And IVC is one of the most developed civilization at that time.\n\n\n\nAlso remember we humans are not just one species, but we are one subspecies. 10000 years ago some natural calamity happened, and there were only 1000 breeding pairs of humans remained. Thus we are extremely closely related. Two chimpanzees have more genetic variance than whole human race. As I said, you need to read more about genes before you talk about them.\n\n\nAnd honestly, caste system is local. South Indian Brahmin have more common with South Indian dalits than North Indian brahmins etc.\n\n\n\nWe do not talk about genetics because it is too embarrassing. North Indians and south Indians are extremely different genetically. North Indians are as different than south Indians as they are different than Chinese. Don't go there.\n\n\u003e And hygiene, No, I plainly meant hygiene and not purity or impurity of Hindu dharma\n\n\nYes and that's why I said you were wrong. Caste system was created so that minority can rule majority. They invented these eating habits things. Again these caste apologist used God knows what to support untouchability. Your implication that Brahmin might be cleanest caste is not just wrong, but very laughable. Don't fall for their ever changing propaganda.","I am honestly not aware of them.

That was asked by the client and later after I provided the test reports I got money somewhat more than the price of iPhone (second-hand). \n\nIn my case, I use only calling, SMS, Safari browser, Uber, Instagram. Battery lasts a day. I am not moving to another phone because I don't need another phone. My work gets done by this one, and don't want to spend money in buying something which I won't be using much.","I have an iPhone 6s, 2015 13‚Äù MacBook Pro, AirPods and an Apple Watch. I started with iPhone, then bought a MacBook and bought AirPods and Apple Watch S4 thereafter. When I bought the phone, it seemed to be the better option compared to Androids at that time(S7, OnePlus 2). \n\nThen, I needed a laptop. IMO 2015 MacBook Pro is still the best laptop you can buy. It has excellent trackpad, very good speakers, good keyboard, and macOS works very well with iOS. Apple laptops are very durable too. Hence, I bought MacBook Pro. \n\nThe experience of using an iPhone along with MacBook Pro is incredible. Handoff between iPhone and MacBook, picking calls, seeing messages on mac, universal clipboard are too good. The products are very durable too. I am typing this on a phone bought over 1000 days ago which I updated to iOS 13 beta few days ago and is better than ever save for battery life.\n\nAirPods are awesome for casual listening and very comfortable for long hours. My ears pain when I wear in-ear earphones for more than 30 minutes. They work very well with both the phone and mac. Having Siri on Airpods is great. \n\nRecently started using Apple Watch for tracking walks. It has a very good interface for iMessage and I love chatting using Apple Watch. \n\nI agree that Apple products don‚Äôt provide 2x utility over the phones which cost 1/2 of that. But no other products connect as seamlessly out of the box as Apple products do. \n\nAll things considered, I would say Apple products have good value for money at least for my needs.","I have a 2014 MacBook Air, iPhone XS, AirPods, Apple Watch and a Time Capsule.

I got the AirPods as a gift and wouldn‚Äôt buy them other wise.\n\nBut I think I bought so many because:\n1. They last quite well. They don‚Äôt slow down as fast as windows or a couple of androids my friends have owned.\n2. The ecosystem works really well. There are small things that you get used to. Like the watch and phone syncing seamlessly along with the AirPods, copy paste between phone and laptop, unlocking the Mac with the watch and hence not needing a password, the fact that my laptop backs itself to the time capsule every time I connect to the internet at home.\n3. The security that Apple offers. This may just be marketing, but I do believe that they care about user privacy and security and some of their developments in Safari etc back this up.","Ipod touch 2nd Gen.

I don‚Äôt have to worry about an app not being supported for optimum performance for my 4 year old phone.\n4. It‚Äôs goes great with my laptop and iPad, I have recently bought. The ecosystem is the most underrated thing with apple.\n5. I get a stand-alone user experience not having to worry if the next update is supported by my hardware etc. I don‚Äôt have to worry about things like ROM(miui, stock etc), RAM, processors etc. Just go and pick an iPhone in your budget when you feel the current one is dying out.","iPad \n\nI wanted to go paperless and iPad with pencil is awesome to take all the notes.

My mom surprise gifted me the MBP when I already had the iMac. Next generation will probably sell them both and get a 15‚Äù MBP. \n\nUse the iPad just for media browsing, Reddit and occasional games (PUBG is pretty awesome on the iPad). \n\nWhy Apple? I can afford them and also I ask friends to get them for me from US, so it‚Äôs cheaper. \n\nThey last a long time. My previous MBP lasted for 6 years while my friends were changing their windows system once every 2 years or so. I‚Äôve no plans to upgrade my MBP for another 2/3 years. The MBP‚Äôs touchpad is at a god level where I can even do minute editing details without the need for a mouse, couldn‚Äôt find such a touch pad in a windows machine yet, it‚Äôs so good I even bought a touch pad for my iMac. \n\nAlso Apples warranty is pretty solid even in India. Just 2 months ago, 3.5 years into buying the laptop, due to staingate policy, I got my casing, LCD panel, keyboard and touch pad changed. No other company would honor something that was purchased years ago. They even replaced my water damaged 4s a few years ago. Over the years, I got multiple things replaced out of warranty too. Also they‚Äôve international warranty, not many companies offer that. \n\nI‚Äôve used multiple android phones over the years and always find myself getting back to the iPhone. Why iPhone? Because it doesn‚Äôt get slow after 8 months of use age. I didn‚Äôt have this problem with the google line of phones but with 1+ and Samsung, they used to get slow after a few months of use age. It used to be so annoying. Plus with android, I used to spent half the time tinkering with customization, trying to make them perfect, with iPhone, nothing to customize, just use the damn thing. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äòecosystem‚Äô because I think Googles ecosystem is better in terms of software services.","I have an iPhone6s from Late 2015. The phone is low on storage since i got the 16gb one but this phone is good.

I wanted to try out iOS ecosystem since i was always an android fan.\n\nReason behind why i am keeping it: i WANT a phone (android probably) but i don't NEED one right now. This one works perfect despite cracks on the screen. iOS 13 is round the corner and good thing about iOS is all the devices regardless of Xs or X,8,7,6s, they get the update on the same day.

I have dropped my iPod at least 100 times, has gone through a daily grind for almost 15 years before the battery gave out. The Macbook Pro still runs as a daily driver. I just replaced Mac OS with Arch, and everything runs super smooth.\n\nThe best thing about all of them is that they all connect to each other seamlessly. The worst is that they don't like Windows or Linux; and Apple's software philosophy (especially iOS) is dumb AF! If you're not using a Mac, you're screwed!","I‚Äôve got an iPhone 7, a MacBook Pro (2016, 13‚Äù) and as of last week, a series 3 Apple Watch. \n\nAs for the why? MacBooks are (or used to be before the butterfly keyboards) built like tanks. My old 2010 would still be going strong if not for a battery. Personally I‚Äôve since switched to a mechanical keyboard so the butterfly reliability doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. \n\nThe phone - everyone on my family uses an iDevice so services like iMessage and FaceTime are essential to me. On top of that, the integration between iOS and macOS is insane. \n\nRegarding the watch - I got into fitness in a huge way in the beginning of this year and I‚Äôve since dropped 25~ kilos and started lifting. I was using a miband but the Apple Watch is a huge step up. \n\nRegarding the prices - both the watch and laptop were purchased outside where prices are considerably cheaper and I got the phone for roughly 30k inr during some sale last October.","Have an iPhone 6 and iPad 2 .

The hinges are top quality, the plastic keyboards can take a pounding, unbelievably good speakers on the laptops.\n* Premium Feel: Touch an apple product and you can tell the difference.\n* Design: They are leaders in design and aesthetics (not so much in the Tim Cook era)\n* Ease of use: UI and UX is top notch and so logical\n* No Bloatware or Adware: IOX and OSX is fast fluid and contains no unnecessary extras or launchers. No ads like in Windows.\n* Not many Malware or Viruses\n* Runs smoother and without slowing down for years: My Windows machines were notorious. After 1-2 years the machine gets slower. Parents bought a Windows laptop and in less than a year it was struggling to start up in less than 3-4 minutes. Gifted them my 3 year old Macbook 12 and they love it.\n* Retina Screen: Colour reproduction and resolution is top notch\n* Touchpad: No laptop can come close to the Apple Touchpad\n* Sync between devices in eco-system: Save a friend's wifi password on my phone. Pull out my mac and it logs in to the wifi automatically.\n* Re-sale value: I change devices every 2 years or so.

Let's say, you try your hands on esports, you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it. Then you need to get a job and that's only backed up by education. No firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv. Not to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports, there's a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewer.\n\nThe same is applicable for other type of sports.

Currently in the US and there are a lot of British expats at work and none seem to be following cricket.

British and Aussie cricketers were not just sports stars but we're also page 3 personalities. I don't think it is like that anymore. Does anyone remember Shane Warne and Liz Hurley?

I have mentioned there that anybody can message me regarding fitness advice and I have got quite a good number of messages ,I have replied to all of them ,some of them were regarding diet,some about weight loss and some regarding general fitness. I have been lifting for about 3 years and have even done a competition around 2017(I will include pic as well if anybody wants to see). After reading,implementing and going through multiple phases I can say I have sound knowledge on fitness. I am thinking of making fitness related plans such as weight loss,general fitness etc. Now you must be thinking that there are lot of resources out there and why we should enlist in my programs ,yeah you are right but the information on the internet is quite overwhelming . You may see hundreds of exercises but won't get a proper plan which suits your body and goal. Yeah you can buy a program too from any fitness guy from US,UK etc but they charge like hundreds of dollars and have hundreds of clients. The thing is I have applied lot of knowledge in my own physique and have been through ulcer etc due to hostel food which helped in finding more about my body. So I will be taking 10-15 people at starting making custom plans for them and will be charging a nominal fee. The best thing about the program is even of that nominal fee you can pay 60-75% at beginning and remaining after 4 weeks if the program is of 12 weeks. I will be checking on everyone that takes the plan weekly checking their progress, measurements , prescribing any changes. So that's all.\n\nYou can comment down and ping me if you are interested. \nDo let me know if this is a great idea.","over_18":false,"time":1.559920412e+09,"comments":["Hey man, thanks for doing this.\n\nI just need advice regarding calorie counting for Indian food. Is it really necessary if you just eat healthy food in general? And if yes, how do you count calories for Indian food? There are just so many varieties, so many different methods to cook the same thing that I just feel it'd be impossible for me to do this.\n\nAnother thing is I'm not too overweight. I think I weighed around 69 kg, the last time I measured it. I'm a little below 5'7\". So I think my ideal weight should be around 64 kgs. So I'm planning to lose weight first, and then start building muscles. I'm just doing intermittent fasting and some running in the morning. Is this the correct approach?\n\nAnd finally, it's quite hard to have healthy diet living in hostel. Mess food isn't particularly healthy.

Regarding calorie counting- yes buddy you are right,you can never count the exact calories for our indian food but apps like healthifyme etc are good as per Indian food. The thing is if you are not a competitor then you don't even have to be precise ,even a 10-20% error rate is good for you if you eat healthy.\n2.There is no ideal weight . Ever person is diff,they just take an avg to justify it ,you have to consider many factors such as bone density,water retention etc to get a sound number,what i would recommend you is to get your body fat checked,figures like visceral fat,water retention etc will give you a good idea. See in the mirror,take measurements etc. Regarding weight loss ,try being true to yourself and stick to a plan . \n3. Final point, i have suffered ulcers, dysentery, diarrhea etc due to hostel food,hell I have even lost 17+kgs in a week due to all these. Regarding cheap diet include eggs(in a limit as per cholesterol),buy a normal peanut butter ,it will cost you around 275 for 950gms,try including brown bread -costs around 30 rupees will last about 3-4 days,buy peanuts(.5-1kg) etc \n\nI hope this will be helpful to you","Hey, not to barge in on OP's thread but here's what I think:\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\n1. If it's necessary or not to count calories depends on your goals, I'll get back to this later\n2. Assuming you've never worked out properly(following a diet and workout plan, regularly) before, as a beginner you can realistically gain muscle and burn fat at the same time. This ability dies down after like 6 months - a year(depending on your genetics) but beginners can definitely achieve this. All you need to do is remain in your calorie maintenance phase, maybe even a small surplus(100-250 calories).\n3. Alright so now we can go back to point 1, how many calories you should consume and if it's necessary to count calories at all? Well, if you want to start working out you should know you will be able to burn fat and gain muscle if you work out properly and regularly. If you just want to lose weight then yeah you probably will need to count calories because, from personal experience, we grossly overestimate the amount of calories we consume.","Free advice is available all over the internet. Custom meal plans and workout routines with regular check ins and advice are more of a deal you can get anywhere for free.","The problem with free is that nobody works hard if they get it without any price ,if somebody has paid then they are likely to work harder ,plus the plans may diff acc to goal so it's a lot of work plus weekly checks etc are included as well","Thanks man,you can dm me your goal and current stats and I will start making a plan acc to your goal","np,you can hmu whenever you feel like and work harder in the initial phase because newbie gains are the best,you can have a big change in the initial phase","great you can message me your goal ,stats and the time you have been working out","Please dm me you goal,stats and the time you have been working out","and what would be the thread about ?

They won't carry ticketless passengers, thus saving money on fuel and maximizing per train revenue. They will run trains on schedule, without delays, thereby increasing turnover per train. In short, their operation cost will be far lower than that of IR, resulting in operating profits potentially at even low ticket prices.\n\nSimply compare it to the Airline industry, specifically Indigo vs Air India.

Government is doing blatant crony capitalism and yet this is the #1 concern.\n\nWell done","\nThis is fun in the short term. In the long term we need to discuss which entity ‚Äî the profitable private one or the bankrupt public one ‚Äî is in charge of maintaining and upgrading the tracks. Keep in mind private companies cannot run faster trains on our current tracks without upgrading them. \n\nThis would mean our government would need to be like Japan and provide low interest construction loans to private companies, except that we don‚Äôt have money to do so and a government that bends over backwards for the Aam Aadmi is not likely to give away public funds to build exclusive spaces for the elite. This is part of the reason our expressway construction is so slow. \n\nFurthermore, we need to decide who is in charge of expanding our railway network. Private companies will happily run profitable routes. IR will be forced to run minor routes and our government will be forced to use an ever larger portion of the budget to service this debt obligation. After a certain point, investors and lenders will ignore the IR because of its bad financial situation. \n\nAdditionally, private players are only more efficient if they‚Äôre not a monopoly. This creation of monopolies is not a great idea. \n\nMoreover, Imm not even inherently opposed to privatization. I think it could do a lot of good. But why start here when there are better candidates, like the suburban rail in Mumbai or Calcutta and the freight trains that could be privatized instead? In this scenario, freight will still be charged to subsidize passenger rail, and the IR will still be in a bad financial situation at the end of it. \n\nAnd what about foreign ownership of parts of our rail network? Are we ready for that? \n\nI‚Äôm just asking where this will lead. There is no guarantee that privatizing the railways leads to efficiency. We need to be really careful here, or we will be left with overpriced foreign services connecting our cities and leaving behind smaller towns.","OP is saying about \"eating taxpayer money endlessly\" part of AI.","Only the latter. Can you imagine the blame-fest if a private loco operator caused an accident?","Apologies for misreading what you originally intended.

Yes, it might eventually bring us to a point with not too much improvement from the current system in India but I believe it will be a net positive.","Privatization happened in Roads, Metro why not in rail too. Should happen through competitive auction of route by route. Furthermore, make private trains pay for the priority slots, number of trips taken on a pay-per-use basis, which goes to fund the development of tracks. The money generated upfront from auction and over lifetime through usage fee goes in a separate corpus to improve tracks and build new ones.\n\nAirline, Roads, Retail, Food have FDI to certain limits. Home ministry already vets the FDI participants in case of sectors of importance. Use the same norms in Rail, with national security clauses allowing Government to take of in case of emergencies, war, national security scenarios.","True, which also means that the private operator has no control on delays. \n\nJust manpower. \n\nWhat's in it for a Private Contractor?","I‚Äôd like to point you to this article:\n\nhttps://www.citylab.com/transportation/2011/10/why-tokyos-privately-owned-rail-systems-work-so-well/389/\n\nEspecially this bit:\n\n\u003e While JNR privatization was a success in the three large metropolitan regions, and especially Tokyo, the smaller cities and regional areas are another story. When JNR was broken up in 1987, the networks outside of Tokyo-Nagoya-Osaka were not fully privatized, and the longer lines are still owned by the national government in the form of smaller \"JR\" companies. Shorter lines, called \"third-sector\" railways, have been devolved to local governments and private investors. Profit-making private firms exist outside of the three metropolitan areas just as there are third-sector railways within, but they are the exception to the norm. Many third-sector railways outside of the Tokaido megalopolis are now in peril as their stabilization funds dwindle and further subsidies become unsustainable. \n \n\u003e In this way, the railroad finances reveal a deeper Japanese demographic trend: the countryside and many regional cities are emptying out. \n\nMind you, this is what happens when things go perfectly *right*. When it goes wrong, we all lose out. Moreover, India is decades away from our villages and towns being emptied out. \n\nIf we are going to phase out the IR as we know it, there must be a comprehensive plan for what will replace it, something to aim for. Otherwise just taking vague steps in the dark is equivalent to death by a thousand cuts. \n\nLet us know what the plan is for these private train companies. What are the charges? How will they be legally liable? How will they be held accountable? What is their obligation to connect small stations to larger ones? Etc.","It's IRCTC - not really a \"private\" operator","\u003e Let us know what the plan is for these private train companies. What are the charges? How will they be legally liable? How will they be held accountable? What is their obligation to connect small stations to larger ones? Etc.\n\nI am not someone who is planning this, but those who are, must be creating a long-term plan. I agree with Japan model i.e. competing train companies operating their own few routes, not a large private monopoly. Ask private players to bid on a route by route basis, either upfront money or revenue share. Let them build the tracks, let them do a Japan partnership for rolling stock and cheap interest rates (like DMRC has done).\n\nThere is no obligation on private company beyond operating and maintaining the route it has bid for. Government milks money from privatization of profitable routes, and subsidizes IR for the non-profitable routes. \n\nCharges are to be set using a price cap or rate-of-return mechanisms (similar to Power, Airports sector in India). Minimum Peak Demand capacity to be built foretasted and built in the contract, so that there is no shortages of seats and hence no possibility of favoritism in seat reservations.\n\nTheir liability in case of accidents is same as what would there be in case of any other private company handling PAX transport e.g. buses, airlines.

From an ecological perspective there's the question of where to dispose of the brine that's produced as a result of desalination. The obvious answer would be to throw it back to the sea, but releasing such a high concentration of salt into the sea does have an impact on the local marine life, which in turn will hurt our fisheries. There are solutions to these of course, such as releasing the brine over a large area in the sea by laying out pipes over that area. Which of course raises the cost.\n\nDesalination is also expensive. For instance it costs $1bn to supply 7% of the water needed by San Diego. Bangalore alone is ten times of San Diego. You do the math. \n\nAnd all of this is treating the symptom. The reality is this is caused by our unsustainable dependence on water intensive crops like sugar and cotton.

Here's why we think this would result in a terrible outcome.\n\n* **Increased power of social media companies over users:** It would undermine the right to privacy in several ways. At present we can only visualise a few, and as we very well know with technology based policy interventions, the outcomes are often much worse and the threats only multiple when user rights are not considered at the outset. For instance, it would allow social media companies to gather deeper, more granular information about their users. A government ID, especially one such as Aadhaar which has a common identifier would permit them to link the personal data on the social media platform more easily. This would result in more pervasive dossiers of social media users available to the highest bidder who can serve us then with ads across platforms. Not to mention it would also increase the harms to speech by chilling dissenting voices.\n* **Troubling legality:** This also becomes troubling neatly on the legality of the proposal. As per us, the private use of Aadhaar remains problematic as indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. This becomes incredibly dangerous when it is mandatorily linked to our social media accounts. All this is happening while we are still governed by deficient safeguards, that were devised for telephone tapping applied to digital surveillance by the government. In a related matter to reform the safeguards for government surveillance (which is at present occurring without any judicial oversight) we have made a constitutional challenge through a petition in the Supreme Court of India by filing *Internet Freedom Foundation v. Union of India* (W.P. (C). No. 44/2019) \\[Soon coming up for hearing on July 2, 2019\\].\n* **Increased risk to minors and women:** Linking real world identities may counter intuitively also contribute to the spreading of misinformation, abuse and threats which not only result in a direct attack against our democracy but also allows for individualised harms which more often come through to women and children. Women (other persons as well, especially individuals from vulnerable groups) in India quite often have adopted pseudonyms on social media to avoid censure from family, acquaintances or wider social judgement. Linking their Aadhaar to their social media accounts would tremendously increase informational risks even rising to the level of threats to their physical security.\n\n### /// A short statement on today's developments\n\nIFF's executive director, Apar Gupta stated that, \"*We are grateful to the Hon'ble Madras High Court for permitting us to make submissions given the vexed issues of Aadhaar and social media linking. This was possible due to the submissions of our counsel Suhrith Parthasarthy who is advising and representing us in this case. He also indicated the larger issues before the court on which we plan to engage in future hearings. Given the pervasive use of social media in our lives and the existing tools to harvest and utilise data for marketing purposes, not to mention, individualised advertisements, the entire gathering of personal data itself has been a constant cause for concern in the law few years. Adding Aadhaar to this cocktail for the purpose of verification of identity would arguably create further harm. This case also concerns issues of online abuse, misinformation which can contribute to challenges to social order and when law enforcement is deficient, even violence. Hence, the Hon'ble Court has also in recent hearings been considering issues of intermediary liability and end-to-end encryption. On all these issues, IFF's staff will work with care to ensure submissions are made to safeguard and protect the digital rights of every social media user in India.*\"\n\nIn continuance with IFF's mission -- we will keep approaching courts in a systematic and planned manner to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights of every India.\n\nTransparency is a hallmark in all of IFF's work. Hence, as with all our filed case pleadings even a copy of the intervention application is made public and is available in the link below. The next date for hearing in this case is July 26, 2019.\n\n### Important documents\n\n* Intervention Application (W.M.P No. 16726 of 2019) ([**link**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yrhnSe8Ve1-lZY-uPzsgmKAN8B1jwHhf)) in Antony Clement Rubin v.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d335e77ba9c57f14063dab3"},"flair":"Policy","selftext":"https://i.redd.it/pasrqtt6sqy21.png\n\n## Highlights\n\n* **Background:** IFF has received an increasing number of reports through its online reporting tool, of various net neutrality violations. A particularly interesting response also informed us of browser injections by BSNL.\n* **Need for security:** BSNL's disregard to the security of their networks is alarming given the sensitivity of the nature of information transmitted in these fields. We ask BSNL to take necessary recourse in addressing the issue.\n\n## Background\n\nIn [**our previous posts**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-a-week-updates-from-savetheinternet-on-website-blocking/), we introduced our online reporting tool to keep a record of Net Neutrality violations around India. One of the responses that stood out informed us of browser injections by BSNL permitting advertisements, on non-HTTPS sites. We decided to look into the issue further, which led to the discovery of numerous public complaints on social networking platforms and discussion forums of similar injections.\n\n## Venomous code injections\n\nTechniques such as code injections are generally used to gain unauthorised access to systems, compromise the integrity and safety of sensitive data or deny access amongst other significantly detrimental consequences. After learning of its prevalence within the BSNL services, it led to concern not only the security of the information involved but especially the illegality of their actions, so we put it to the test against various frameworks in existence.\n\n* **The Information Technology Act, 2000**Section 43 of the Act provides various protections to information that is within a computer resource, in order to maintain its integrity and security from unauthorised attacks. Hacking of a computer system deceptively, in such a manner, would even render one punishable by fine or imprisonment under Section 66 of the Act.Not only is injecting code done without the knowledge of the individual, its purpose is to undermine the vulnerabilities of the code to fulfil its own agenda.\n* **Cellular Media Telephone Services Agreement**As far as we could find, BSNL is governed by the provisions of Cellular Media Telephone Services agreement which specifies in clause 44.4 that the Licensee (BSNL) is to ‚Äò*ensure protection of privacy of communication and ensure that unauthorized interception of messages does not take place.*‚ÄôPermitting such insertion of code definitely permits unauthorised interception of the original code which in all likelihood puts in jeopardy the security and protection of the privacy of the transmission. This is in clear breach of its own license conditions.\n\nThe Department of Telecommunications also circulated a notice providing for minimum requirements of security to be met by Licensee, in line with the DoT‚Äôs licensing conditions in May 2011. It specifically expects measures to be in place against intrusion of malware, protection of information in networks and its facilities, basic updated security measures in compliance with statutory, regulatory, licensing or contractual obligations. BSNL appears to be clearly failing to meet these requirements.\n\nSo we decided to write to BSNL stating exactly this; explaining how it is in contravention with a multitude of provisions ([**Read it here**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q7aFOmqCOzvRaoifMheTOE16AdRTmI-b)). In addition to this, we have also attached to this representation, a compilation of various reports of such code injections. Such thorough documentation has only been possible to the proactive users of India Broadband Forum, Twitter and Reddit (you guys have led us to some pretty intense discussion forums).\n\nWe provide BSNL with some necessary next steps, provided below, ¬†in not only addressing the issue but to provide some accountability for their lack of redressal over user complaints.\n\n* **Investigate**: Formulate a working group to coordinate the legal and technological departments and then conduct an official audit, specifically investigating each reported incident and identify the reasons for its occurrence in different geographies.\n* **Disclose:** Public disclosure of the findings of the audit and take the proportionate corrective measures.\n* **Fix:** Take immediate actions in the interim as well as standing instructions which may be considered to prevent recurrence.\n\nWe are optimistic that BSNL will pay heed to our representation and take needed action. ¬†We do mention that in case of failure to do so, IFF fully intends to move forward with strategic steps to approach Government authorities including CERT IN and the Department of Telecommunication to bring awareness and the required response in strengthening existing security measures.\n\n## Link to important documents\n\n* Representation to BSNL on Code Injections \\[[**link**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q7aFOmqCOzvRaoifMheTOE16AdRTmI-b)\\]\n\n## Ads making you mad?

BSNL/MTNL by default have their own nameservers set up  in your router config when they configure your internet.  \nThis is also how they block websites, since they know what domain the request is going to.  \nChange your domain name servers to either google's DNS \\(8.8.8.8/4.4.4.4\\) or other DNS provider in your router settings.  \nThe caveat here is google or whatever DNS provider you choose can see what site you are requesting.  \n/u/InternetFreedomIn  \nSeveral other internet providers also block at the DNS level.  \nI skimmed through the complaints posted on the google sheet and most of those blocks can  \nbe circumvented in this way.","Thank you.

Also, how does one differentiate between the injected ads and the ads hosted on webpage? Is there anyway to block them? Adblocker or something like that?","HTTPS is the proper solution in the long run, even for laypeople. Ads and malware can be injected into non HTTPS websites by many agents, not just the ISP. For example, even your local Wifi access point can inject malware, or hijack your data.\n\nSo, apart from legal action, it is important to educate people about using secure websites. The leading browsers have started marking non-https websites with red color in their URL bars, but more needs to be done to make users aware of the importance of HTTPS.","Thanks hitch!","\u003c3 \u003c3 \u003c3","Dvois SSV, the ISP in the area where I live, \"claims\" to provide 1Gbps but the sales guy said that I probably won't get more than 300Mbps even if I have a router capable of handling 1Gbps. The maximum speed that they offer without FUP is 80Mbps.\n\nSo yeah, an ISP can claim many things and do something else entirely.\n\nAn ISP back in Lucknow said to me that I'm getting 20Mbps on a 50Mbps plan because they advertise their plans as \"upto\" 50Mbps. I asked them if I get 1Mbps which is technically still \"upto\" 50Mbps, would it be okay according to them? They disconnected my call.","Fair Usage Plan ... or in simple terms, data caps.\n\nLet's say that you pay an ISP ‚Çπ800 for a 50Mbps connection per month. Most ISPs say that it's an \"unlimited\" plan but you would end up getting 50Mbps speeds for only about 100GB or 200GB of data. After that, they'll downgrade your speed from fiber quality 50Mbps to shitty DSL quality 512Kbps and keep calling it unlimited.\n\nThis is what FUP means.\n\nIdeally, there should be no data caps because giving real unlimited plans doesn't really cost anything more to the ISPs. They just like to milk profits from customers. In this age of 4K streaming, data caps make no sense.\n\nhttp://money.com/money/4360431/internet-data-caps-bogus-ploys/","So what's the final verdict on this folks?

Any click will redirect you to a different site. This is generally malware behavior, so people scan and try to fix their devices. Of course, it doesn't work. \n\nInitially, BSNL was using Cobalten services to redirect networks, you can actually see the spike in people searching for \"cobalten virus\" over the last year, that's clueless bsnl users trying to find a fix.\n\nThey may have moved to a different service now, but it's difficult to say since I've installed a range of scripts and blockers to stop the code injections.","I took a Google Trends screenshot for \"Cobalten virus\", notice the surge last year and simultaneous discussions appearing on several sites including reddit.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dT782Dr","injected ads are generally not part of the website layout. they would appear outside the body of the content. so think of it like slide outs from bottom center or bottom right (like in the screenshot in post above) or popups in center of screen. they would also only appear on http websites. the push for https means that you would probably never encounter them on popular web services most of which have already switched on https. \n\nblocking them i suppose is possible but the servers and ips keep on changing. so you would have to keep on finding out the source and blocking them as they keep on changing.","Your points are valid ..","https://i.redd.it/lmokp4143jq11.png","Thank you so much for the detailed answer.

OP is making a technical opinion on the statement of the issue. I actually deal with the problem! I've used open DNS and Google DNS. Doesn't work.","I was a BSNL customer earlier. Their ads are not based on DNS attacks. They inject scripts directly in the HTML response from an HTTP request. The only solution against the attack is to use HTTPS websites.\n\nUsing a better and more secure DNS provider is still beneficial because it protects against DNS poisoning which is very easy to do on an encrypted DNS channel.\n\nFirefox already has support for DNS-over-https in the latest version, but is not enabled by default. Other browsers will hopefully implement this soon.","Hmm, also it's the provider so I don't think it's too difficult for them to spam us with ads. Thanks, once again.","There's isn't much point in showing that photo unless you tell us who the ISP is. There's no personal info that you can possibly disclose by telling us your ISP and your city unless you're using a corporate internet with only a few people who have access to those speeds.","\u003e When my parents raise complaints, they just give stupid excuses.\n\nYeah, I once made the mistake of subscribing to BSNL and when I complained about the speed, they asked me which websites am I using. I told them Reddit and The Guardian and they said that since I'm using foreign websites, it's an issue on their end and they can't do anything about it.\n\nI still cringe when I think about that time.\n\nBesides a few cities like Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Mumbai, there are no cities in India where one can get a decent Internet connection.","It does on MTNL.  \nLong time MTNL user, ads stopped on switching DNS provider.  \nWith respect to the BSNL stuff, the next time an ad pops up, could you note down the ip its sent from?  \nUblock origin has an element picker mode - click-select the banner, and it automatically creates a cosmetic filter.  \nNo need to keep the developer tools open, although you could capture traffic this way too.  \nThey must have a limited number of adservers through which they do this injection.","the good thing is that modern technologies make it extremely hard for them to do so. but for that to work... the web services have to do some additional work and the end user has to use modern browsers capable of supporting those technologies. https already makes it hard for them to interfere with online traffic. technologies like esni and dnssec would further boost security of online traffic. \n\n[Encrypting SNI: Fixing One of the Core Internet Bugs](https://blog.cloudflare.com/esni/)","Yup, thanks to ACT stepping up its game.

Check out the¬†Fuel Cost Savings Calculator¬†on the My Electric Car website.\n\nCheaper to maintain\n\nA¬†battery electric vehicle (BEV)¬†has a lot less moving parts than a conventional petrol/diesel car. There is relatively little servicing and no expensive exhaust systems, starter motors, fuel injection systems, radiators and many other parts that aren‚Äôt needed in an EV.\n\nLess pollution: By choosing to drive an EV you are helping to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions. An EV has zero exhaust emissions5.\n\nRenewable energy:¬†If you use renewable energy to recharge your EV, you can reduce your greenhouse gas emissions even further.¬†¬†You could recharge your EV from your solar PV system during the day instead of from the grid.¬†¬†Another idea is to purchase¬†GreenPower¬†from your electricity retailer. Then, even if you recharge your EV from the grid, your greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.\n\nEco-friendly materials:¬†There is also a trend towards more eco-friendly production and materials for EVs. The Ford Focus Electric is made up of recycled materials and the padding is made out of bio based materials. The Nissan Leaf‚Äôs interior and bodywork are partly made out of green materials such as recycled water bottles, plastic bags, old car parts and even second hand home appliances6.\n\nHealth benefits\n\nReduced harmful exhaust emissions is good news for our health. Better air quality will lead to less health problems and costs caused by air pollution. EVs are also quieter than petrol/diesel vehicles, which means less noise pollution.\n\n\n\nAlso think about it logically, power plants produce their smoke in the outskirts of the city. Sure, there will be pollution, but the quality of air in city will improve. For ex, at red light now, everyone's engine is running and that makes the air unbreathable. If there was only EV, no such phenomena would take place.","I'm not worri d about them not surviving I'm worried about our government subsidizing things that pollute and aren't the best mode of transportation","When you look at the engine as an isolated system the numbers seem high. But the human driver efficiency, road conditions, traffic conditions, other mechanical parts reduce the efficiency. The actual energy conversion efficiency is less than 40%.","I might accept the argument about noise pollution and renewable energy. Thinking about it logically and from thermodynamics POV. It is better to convert energy efficiently, the more steps the more loss of efficiency. It might be better for city but as a whole for the world it triggers more emissions and climate change.","You talking about autos?","Are you talking about IC engine or electric motors?","You forget about the Pollution happening at the refinery level and transportation for Petroleum related products","If IC Engines were efficient, we would use the same process for large scale industrial power plants.

Do Google it for yourself, but the efficiency of electric motors have been shown to be significantly more efficient than IC engines. It's not just \"number of steps\" but efficiency of each of those steps. And IC engines are very inefficient","Both of them are the same, when it comes to on road performance.

But before that, India's power production mainly comes from coal, hence a 17-25% efficiency in thermal plants if I am being generous. That electricity is also not efficiently used in motors. If a simple Google search gives you claims of 52-75%. A rule of thumb assumption is 40%. This is a very crude way to deal but a good initial point.

A coal plant will be more efficient at generating energy than a car engine(Lesser average generation of waste for large plants).

It is even possible that Lithium may get replaced with something like Aluminium-Air which is mechanically recharged in minutes in near future. Perhaps even a breakthrough in super capacitors may render batteries useless. You don't have to change the whole vehicle to change the battery tech. It's modular for a reason.

If you use the vehicle only on weekends that is 50km per weekend, which is a much more reliable figure.\n\nCompanies like Ather give a 3 year warranty on battery with 70% charge retention after 3 years.

But unless there is mass adoption of EV , there will barely be a dent in overall emissions. \n\nIt's the government job to take care of the environment. Effective subsidies will be instrumental for bringing EVs to the masses. Which is currently absent from the scenario. No incentive for the companies , no incentive for the people. Just a deadline. That doesn't help anything.","India is rapidly moving towards renewable energy, soon we will be producing more renewable energy than non-renewable energy.

With powerplants you can run them to extract max energy, and with waste heat exchangers, push the thermal extraction even more than possible in ICE.

Although construction of ICE cars produces lesser emissions than EV counterparts.","Enfield managed 40 kmpl with air cooled 350cc engines.

Payments can be \"Requested\" to you by intended party, and you can accept, if you really want to.\n\nIt's an important feature, used by third-party apps like BMS, that send you a request from their UPI channel, requesting the exact amount. \n\nHowever, it can be exploited against those who don't know about this feature.

Please cross check the amount and vendor before further proceeding to prevent fraudulent activity.**\n\n\n\n\nDuring transaction, amount and vendor name should be mentioned in OTP webpage, so as to match with SMS.\n\n\nYes, we are always in hurry to complete transaction to avoid session timeout, but atleast change in sms format can be little helpful. As it will have amount details and third party with which we are transacting.","You know this is a failure of our police/judiciary. Each upi account is tied to a bank account and a phone number.

It's a sad reality but many people who need it can't afford it. But if you can **therapy is worth it**.\n\nEDIT : This is important - make sure you go to a qualified therapist. By qualified, I mean that person has either a **post grad in psychological counseling** or an **MPhil in Clinical Psychology from a RCI registered institution**. There are many people who just claim to be therapists and scam people for money, and it's disgusting. Do not hesitate to ask for your therapist's qualifications. Also, ask what session timings they have - therapy sessions are usually 50 minutes long. **Do not accept anything less than 45 minutes.** Do not tolerate behavior like checking phones etc, while the therapist is talking to you - unless they have an emergency. Remember **you're paying for the session.**\n\nAlso, not all therapists suit all people, you might have to visit a few to find one you like. Sadly, psychiatric meds are also like this - you might need to try various types before finding one that suits you.\n\nTherapy is not like going to a dentist where all you have to do is lay back. **Therapy requires a lot of work on your end**, and it is going to be quite hard - **change is hard**.

A lot of them begged to take as much in cash as possible, simply because they depend strongly on these salaries for their day to day essentials, and a miniscule interest income is meaningless.","This will probably not apply to Current accounts.","As someone who works closely with the film industry, the producers do withdraw such amounts on a daily basis that goes to multiple people from camera rental, lightmen, make up, costumer, junior artists, etc. Atleast for the film industry, this is a big blow and would really bump up the cost of production unnecessarily.","\u003e And just why exactly do you imagine I would need to withdraw 50 lakhs in cash? I can‚Äôt think of one reason why, unless I‚Äôm a position where I have no choice, but to convert white money to black.\n\nIf you withdraw 50L in cash, you should be questioned by the IT department; not taxed for withdrawing your own money. \n\nThe reasons for withdrawal could be many; I run a firm where most of my employees are rural employees with no access to bank accounts and their salary cross 10L a year. I may be in trucking business where my drivers are given 50k cash when they start the trip for diesel and other charges. I may be a be a buyer of agro commodities in markets from small traders where cash is the only acceptable mode.","yes it is the same as paying to electrician, plumber and other daily labours for their services without paying the service tax to the govt. then it is white converting to black.","Yeah, I have noticed a trend here.

This is why underground economies exist and it has been foundation for black economy in India. \n\nThe issue with adoption of banking channels has been inconvenience in withdrawing and using money. Also lack of awareness and literacy around banking operations does not help. Now that banking channels are more accessible to poor and prevalence of ATMs, this should ease in addition. The next step is adoption of digital payments. I don‚Äôt need to carry around cash which can be lost, stolen and unrecoverable.","Why should it not? If businesses need 10L of cash, its more likely than not for an illegitimate purpose. For anything else, digital payments are the best.","then they will increase the cost of their percentage with the cinema halls and multiplexes, the govt will fix the ticket prices on the multiplexes and the multiplexes can only earn by charging samosa and popcorn at hundreds of rupees and people who can go to movie theatre and spend extravagantly will cry why samosa is 80 rupees and popcorn is 250 rupees here.","I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll impact as the wording seems like it‚Äôll impact individuals withdrawing from personal accounts, not authorised persons withdrawing from an organisation on the organization‚Äôs behalf","Yes... very true. \n\nBut, in each of these cases, the accounts would be in the name of your company, not in your individual name.\n\nThese rules look like they‚Äôll apply to individuals only.","What would be the in-cash or by-cheque values according to you?","Agree with which part ?","Got it.

Health insurance from a health care industry prescriptive does more harm than good in the long run. One of the main reasons US health care system is so messed up is due to private health insurance companies.\n\nWhen you initially introduce health insurance to a general population that never had insurance before, it is beneficial for both the company because they have low pay outs (profit) and it is great for the person who bought the insurance because they have low premiums and they get good coverage when compared to the premiums they are paying.\n\nHospitals see's that they can charge insurance companies more than they would usually charge a normal individuals so they start preferring insurance patients. Hospitals also realize they can make a higher profit when they focus on reactive care than the pro active care they were initially doing. Everything/everyone in the industry starts following this tread.\n\nOver a period of time, the insurance pool base (people) get older/sicker and insurance companies start increasing premiums. To make up for this insurance companies starts to add people which just makes the situation worse.\n\nLuckily for India the Central Government has a strong hand in medical education so this allows for high volume of medical personnel to graduate every year where they received medical education that can be seen as \"affordable\" for the most part, especially from an international prescriptive.\n\nThe Indian government also runs hospitals which ensures prices are not gouged by the private hospitals.....\n\nedit: why would anyone down vote this? at least leave a comment why you would disagree","Govt's ability to provide effective healthcare shouldn't necessarily have to do with them employing doctors or building hospitals. \n\nI would argue that Ayushman bharat is actually a better model of delivering healthcare than managing hospitals.

I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS.

This is rather suspicious.\n\nFurther, in the original paper, there were two plots that showed exactly the same amount of noise data.

I live and work in the German automotive industry - I've been in OEMs as well as Service Providers in the last 2-3 years. The truth is that a large portion of the engineering of these cars is done by Bosch, Conti, AVL, and a few other Tier-1 service providers.   \n\nThey're under the EU Cartel scanner not for \"delaying clean tech\" but for fixing amongst themselves the negotiation for equipment pricing (so they'd all somehow pay the same to the Tier-1 and Tier-2 providers) and therefore inhibit competition in the market when someone else comes in because they'd compete against a shadow consortium.  \n\nIt's strange, though because there's also another not-so-shadow consortium that's coming up in southern Germany between Daimler and BMW for charging infrastructure. I guess you'd be quite conflicted about that? They're trying now to keep Porsche / VAG and Conti ... er... \"Honest\".   \n\nAlso, BMW and Tesla sold roughly the same number of HEV/BEVs in 2017 or 18.

If this goes on any utensil/surface that you think is 'clean' otherwise, you risk bacterial contamination After cooking your food, when you serve food in that utensil.\n\nIf you take care to avoid this secondary contamination, washing chicken is perfectly safe. I personally wash chicken directly under a low flowing tap without splashing and haven't fallen sick yet.","You can wash the chicken as long as you make sure there is no cross contamination.

I ordered a lunch meal from them (Rs. 100+). When the order arrived, the chicken lolipops was missing. So I chatted with Swiggy CS and they said they would immediately deliver the \"missing\" item. \n\nI finished eating and found the lunch to be horrible - everything was either too watery or too oily. I left a 1 star review and gave specific feedback on what was wrong with the food.\n\nShortly after that Swiggy delivery guy calls me from hotel and says sorry sir, chicken lollipops is not available, can I bring something else. I agree and ask for alternatives. He said some other dish, and I said ok and then he adds - sir you'll have to pay Rs. 50 extra. \n\nI blasted him politely and told him the item is supposed to be free. He said hotel says that no other suitable alternative is available and the alternative is to \"cancel\" the order. I didn't bother arguing with the poor delivery guy. \n\nOfcourse, I am not going to renew my membership.\n\n----x-----\n\nUber Eats: \n\n- Placed an order with McDonalds.\n- Order is accepted by McD.\n- After 45 minutes Uber guy calls and apologises that McD cannot process the order.\n- All good restaurants are closed by then and I had to make chapathis and eggs at midnight.","Both Swiggy and Zomato sucks. Same goes to other restaurant research websites operating in india","My experience with Swiggy has been great. For reference, I live in Hyderabad. They have a great selection of restaurants (much better than Zomato and Uber eats). Their customer service is awesome, if they deliver an incorrect order they either refund your money or send the correct order plus they always have great offers. \n\nIMO Uber eats is the absolute worst, their offers suck, you can‚Äôt combine two coupon codes, they have the lowest number of restaurants, their app is not user-friendly, like you can‚Äôt modify your order easily, you can‚Äôt cancel without talking to an executive first, etc. and they don‚Äôt refund money to your bank account even if you pay through your bank account, they give you Uber credits. Zomato is kind of in between.","Similarly things happened to me on swiggy-super and Zomato. But swiggy-super offers are amazing but then I got swiggy-super for only 1, 1 rs for 2 months.
